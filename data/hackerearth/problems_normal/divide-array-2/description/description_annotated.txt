Given an array †A‡ of size †N‡. Given †Q‡ operations, each operation contains an integer †D‡. In each operation you have to divide all the elements of the array by †D‡.

For example, for each operation with a given †D‡, the new array A would be:

A[0] / D, A[1] / D, A[2] / D, ..... , A[N-1] / D

Finally, after processing all the operations you have to print the final array after †Q‡ operations.
†Note‡ : The result of the each division will be an integer, for example 5 / 2 = 2 

Input
First line of input contains a single integer †N‡ denoting number of elements in the array †A‡.
Next line of input contains †N‡ space separated integers denoting the elements of array †A‡.
Next line contains †Q‡ denoting number of operations.
Next †Q‡ lines contains a single integer †D‡ by which divide the elements of the array.

Output
Print single line containing †N‡ space separated integers after processing †Q‡ operations.   

†Constraints:‡ 
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 100000
1 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 1000000  
1 ≤ †Q‡ ≤ 100000   
1 ≤ †D‡ ≤ 1000

Explanation

In operation 1 after dividing the whole array by D=2, the resultant array will be : [25, 10, 9, 13, 9]
In operation 2 after dividing the array from operation 1 by 3, the resultant array will be : [8, 3, 3, 4, 3]
In operation 3 after dividing the array from operation 2 by 2, the resultant array will be : [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]
So, the resultant array will be [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]
