As of now, you helped agent OO7 to find men with different capability values. Now his task is to group up his men and work as a team. He wants to form the groups with minimum 2 men in it. Help him out to find how many such groups are possible.
Input - First line contains 'T' test cases followed by 'T' lines containing number of men, ‘N’.
Output - 'T' lines containing total number of possible groups.
Constraints - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3 ,  1 ≤ N ≤ 200

SAMPLE INPUT
2
4
6

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
4

Explanation

1) For the 1st case, N is 4. Possible group size can be {2,2}, {4}. So, output is 2.
2) For the 2nd case, N is 6. Possible group size can be {2,2,2}, {2,4}, {3,3}, {6}. So, output is 4.
