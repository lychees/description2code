Suppose you have a string S which has length N and is indexed from 0 to N−1. String R is the reverse of the string S. The string S is funny if the condition |Si−Si−1|=|Ri−Ri−1| is true for every i from 1 to N−1.

(Note: Given a string str, stri denotes the ascii value of the ith character (0-indexed) of str. |x| denotes the absolute value of an integer x)

SAMPLE INPUT
2
acxz
bcxz

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Funny
Not Funny

Explanation

Consider the 1st testcase acxz :

c-a
=
x-z
= 2

z-x
=
a-c
= 2

Consider the 2st testcase bcxz

|c-b| != |x-z|
