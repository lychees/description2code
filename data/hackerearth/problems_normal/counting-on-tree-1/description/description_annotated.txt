You are given a tree consisting of †N‡ nodes, each node i has a value †a[i]‡ (0 ≤ †a[i]‡ ≤ 1) associated with it.

We call a set †S‡ of tree nodes beautiful if following conditions are satisfied:
†S‡ is non-empty.
†S‡ is connected. In other words, if nodes †u‡ and †v‡ are in †S‡, then all nodes lying on the simple path between †u‡ and †v‡ should also be presented in †S‡.
Sum of all †a[u]‡ (†u‡ belong to †S‡) equals to †K‡ where †K‡ is a given integer.

Your task is to count the number of beautiful sets. Since the answer may very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains one integer †T‡ - the number of test cases. Then †T‡ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of several lines.
The first line contains 2 integers †N‡ and †K‡.
The second line contains †N‡ integers †a[1]‡, †a[2]‡, ..., †a[N]‡.
Then the next †N‡ - 1 line each contain pair of integers †u‡ and †v‡ (1 ≤ †u‡, †v‡ ≤ †N‡) denoting that there is an edge between †u‡ and †v‡. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.

Output

For each test, print the answer in one line.
