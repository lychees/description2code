Explanation

In the first case, he can buy 5 chocolates with Rs.10 and exchange the 5 wrappers to get one more chocolate. Thus, the total number of chocolates is 6.

In the second case, he can buy 3 chocolates for Rs.12. However, it takes 4 wrappers to get one more chocolate. He can't avail the offer and hence the total number of chocolates remains 3.

In the third case, he can buy 3 chocolates for Rs.6. Now he can exchange 2 of the 3 wrappers and get 1 additional piece of chocolate. Now he can use his 1 unused wrapper and the 1 wrapper of the new piece of chocolate to get one more piece of chocolate. So the total is 5.
