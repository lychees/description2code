Prayatna decoration work is going on at full swing. In order to decorate the MIT road, Don has an infinite supply of streamers of length m. However, he found out that the distance between two consecutive poles is k, and that (n+1) poles are present, and hence n streamers of length k are required to decorate.

Don plans on cutting the streamers and joining them with glue, so that he gets the required streamers of the required length. Find the minimum number of cuts required.
