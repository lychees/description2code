Pranav just learned about †Modulus(%)‡ and trying to solve a problem on Modulus but he always get TLE. Your task is to help him. Problem is simple, you have been given two numbers A and M and you have to find A%M and print it. 

†Input Format‡ 

†Firstline:‡ T, where T is the number of test cases. Now T line followed, Where each line consist of A and M space separated. 

Constraints

1 ≤T ≤ 100

Number of digit in A ≤ 5×10^5

1 ≤ M ≤ 10^9

†Output Format‡

Print A%M in a new line.

†Sample Input‡

2

12344 12

12 123 

†Sample Output‡

8

12

†NOTE‡ Only C/C++ is allowed for this challenge.
