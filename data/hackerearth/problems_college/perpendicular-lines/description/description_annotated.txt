Foo gave Bar †N‡ lines in the 2D plane, of the form †ax+by+c=0‡. He decided to ask †Q‡ questions to Bar. In every question, he would select a line, and Bar will have to find out †how many lines are perpendicular‡ to the line selected by Foo. Help Bar in answering the questions.

†Input:‡
First line contains a single integer †N‡ - the total number of lines given by Foo to Bar.
N lines follow - each line contains 3 space separated integers: †a‡, †b‡ and †c‡, representing the line †ax+by+c=0‡.
Next line contains a single integer †Q‡ - the number of questions asked by Foo to Bar.
†Q‡ lines follow - each line contains an index between †1‡ and †N‡ (inclusive) - denoting the line selected by Foo.

†Output:‡
Print the number of lines perpendicular to the line selected by Foo.
Print the answer to each question asked by Foo on a new line.

†Constraints:‡
†1‡ ≤ †N‡ ≤ †10^5‡
†10^-9‡ ≤ †a, b, c‡ ≤ †10^9‡
†1‡ ≤ †Q‡ ≤ †10^5‡

Note: All triplets (a, b, c) in the input denote valid straight lines.
