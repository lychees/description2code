Vikrant and Sarthak are roommates and this morning they had a fight over who is smarter.As we all know Sarthak is a geek so he gave Vikrant a task, he gave him a number  N and asked that how many good number we can produce using prime numbers less than or equal to N.
According to Sarthak , we can define a good number as product of two distinct prime numbers.
G=AxB  is good if and only if  *A is prime and *B is prime and A!=B **.
