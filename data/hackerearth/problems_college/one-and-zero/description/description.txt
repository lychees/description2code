Little Raju recently learnt about binary numbers. After spending some time with it, he decided to count in how many ways he can make N digit numbers that is formed by ones and zeroes. But zeroes can not be next to each other. Help him finding in how many different numbers can he make?

Example: There 5  possible ways of making different numbers using 3 digit numbers i.e. 101,010,111,110,011

Input

First line of input contains the total number of test cases T.
Next T lines contain N as explained above.

Output

For each test case print  in newline as explained above.

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4

SAMPLE INPUT
