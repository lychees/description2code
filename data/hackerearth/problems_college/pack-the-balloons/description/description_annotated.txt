Its a Saturday afternoon and Mukul is getting bored lying idle on his cozy bed. His eyes falls on a packet of balloons and some boxes lying on his table. He now wonders how large a balloon he can fit in a given box. Given the dimensions of a box, help Mukul determine the radius of the largest balloon that he can fit in the box. Assume that an inflated balloon will be spherical.

†Input:‡

The first line of the input will be †T‡, the number of test cases.
Next follows †T‡ lines each containing three space separated integers †(L, B, H)‡ which are the length, breadth and height of the box respectively.

†Output:‡

Print †T‡ lines each consisting of the radius(correct to †1‡ decimal place) of the largest balloon that Mukul can fit inthe box of dimensions corresponding to each test case.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ †L, B, H‡ ≤ 10^18
