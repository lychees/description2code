of ladoos that need to be delivered to the guest . Now Bob task is to choose wisely the containers such that he can 
he can take away the amount to be delivered with the minimum number of containers.
Help BOB with his task.

INPUT

First line contain T(T=Number of test cases)

Second line contain W(W=  weight of ladoos need to delivered)

Third line contain M(M= Number of containers)

Next ' M ' lines follows maximum  weight a container can hold.

NOTE1:- If you are using a container you have to use it to the full capacity. You can't use container partially.

NOTE2:- You can use same container more than once.(For more explanation see the test cases)

OUTPUT

Minimum number of container required.

CONSTRAINTS:-

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ W ≤ 1000

1 ≤ M ≤ 8
