Rahul likes to play with mathematics and geometry and when it comes for 2D geometry, he just can’t stop himself doing experiments. While working with 2D geometry, he came up with an interesting pattern of numbers as shown below.

He started at the point (0, 0) and wrote all non-negative integers. They are-
(0, 0) – 0

(1, 1) – 1

(2, 0) – 2

(3, 1) – 3

(2, 2) – 4

(4, 2) – 6

(3, 3) – 5

(5, 3) – 7

(4, 4) – 8

(6, 4) - 10

(5, 5) – 9

(7, 5) – 11

(6, 6) – 12

(8, 6) – 14

(7, 7) – 13
And so on.

Write a program that takes the coordinates(x, y) as the inputs and gives the respective number(if any) on it as output.

Input
1st line is t denoting number of test cases.
Next t lines contains 2 space separated integers denoting the x and y coordinates.

Output
N lines each having the output as the number appearing on the given coordinate. Output “No Number” if there is none.

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 50    where t is the number of test cases

0 ≤ x, y ≤ 500 where x and y are the respective coordinates.

SAMPLE INPUT
3
4 2
6 6
3 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT
6
12
No Number
