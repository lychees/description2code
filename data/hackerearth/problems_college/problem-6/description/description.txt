Joseph  came across the next question , which asked him to check if the word spelt the same backwards .

A simple enough question , he started to solve the question only to be constrained by language allowed.

(Input a string (of character <80) from the user and print whether the string is a palindrome or not. 

Assume no spaces between characters.)
Sample Input:
eergreejj

Sample Output:
Not At All

(If it is a palindrome - print "Indeed")

SAMPLE INPUT
eergreejj

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Not At All
