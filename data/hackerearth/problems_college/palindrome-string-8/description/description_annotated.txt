If he can convert a string into a palindrome by rearranging the characters, he will keep that string, otherwise he will discard that string. You’ve to tell if Arnab will keep that string or not.

†Note:‡ A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward or forward. 

†Input:‡ 
The first line of input contains the number of test cases †T‡. Each test case contains a single string †S‡.

†Output:‡
For each test case print †Yes‡ if Arnab can convert string into a palindrome by rearranging the characters else print †No‡.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †Number of test cases, T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †|Length of String S|‡ ≤ 100
