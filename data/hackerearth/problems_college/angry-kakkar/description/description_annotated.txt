Mrs. Kakkar is a very good maths teacher, but she is extremely competitive. On day her nephew Gazu decided to visit his aunt. Our Gazu arrived and greeted by Mrs Kakkar, after Gazu told her that he is a competitive programmer who deals with many mathematical problems. Mrs Kakkar felt complex and decided to show Gazu his place. She gave Gazu a number N and told him to write product of every even natural number less than 2N AND divide it by product of every odd natural number less than 2N. As our Gazu has some good calculating skills he quickly wrote down the answer on sheet1.

Seeing this Mrs Kakkar got insecure and furious, she snatched Gazu’s sheet and again gave him same number N. This time she told gazu to write the product of every even natural number less than 2N AND divide it by every odd number less than 2(N+1). Gazu again showed off his mathematical skills. and wrote down its answer on this new sheet.

WIth a cunning smile Mrs Kakkar took out the sheet1 and told Gazu to multiply both of these two answers. After he multiplied, Mrs Kakkar took out credit cards from her purse and told Gazu to do the same with the numbers on the credit card. Our completely baffled Gazu is looking on you to rescue him from this situation. You have to make a program to calculate the product of two sequences.

Input
First line contains number of test cases t followed by t lines each contains the credit card number N of Mrs Kakkad.
1 ≤ t<200              1 ≤ N ≤ 4*(10^9)

Output
Print the product of the two sequences, upto two decimal places for each testcase followed by a new line.

SAMPLE INPUT
3
3
10
50

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1.46
1.53
1.56

Explanation

For testcase 1 when N=3, first sequence will be like (246)/(135) and second sequence will be (246)/(1357). Multiplying these two sequences will yield [(246)(246)] / [(135)(1357)] which is equal to 1.46
