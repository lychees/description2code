Your new Math teacher Mr. Primeman has intersting problem for you . He gave you two sets S1 and S2 such that each consists of 
squares of positive integers . Now Mr. Primeman asks you to find prime numbers which can be written as sum of two numbers x and y where
x belongs to S1 and y belongs to S2. Now given a range [a,b] , find count of such numbers .
 
Input
One line containing two numbers a and b respectively. 

 
Output
For range ,output the required answer with newline.

 
Constraints 
0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2*(10^8)
 Example 

SAMPLE INPUT
10 15

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1

Explanation

There are only two prime numbers 11 and 13 between [10,15] while only 13 satisfies the condition 13=2^2+3^2=4+9.
