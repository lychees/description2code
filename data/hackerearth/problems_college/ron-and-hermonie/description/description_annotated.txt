Harry, Ron and Hermonie are in their third year at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizadry. Hermonie has been given a time turner by
Professor McGonagall so that she can study extra subjects. One of 
those subjects is Arithmancy - the study of numbers. Once upon a time,
the three of them are sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room and Hermonie
is completing an essay for Arithmancy. Ron comes up with an arithmancy 
challenge to test Hermonie. He gives her two numbers, B and E, and
Hermonie has to give the last digit of B^E. Since, Hermonie is the brightest
witch of her age, she is able to solve the problem within no time. Now, Ron 
asks her to give the challenge to "That Arithmancy Witch", Professor Vector.
As she is not able to solve the problem, she turns to one of her other
favourite students (you), for help. Find the answer to Hermonie's Challenge
for Professor Vector.
