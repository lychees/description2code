Given a string S of length N consisting of only lower-case English alphabets, you will be asked to process Q queries over it . In each query you will be given two lower case characters X and Y. Your task is to find out the number of such substrings of the the string S which have the characters X  and Y on either of its  end points, both  X...Y  and Y...X are considered to be valid. 

Note :  Substrings length should be greater than 1. 
Input:
The first line of the input will contain N  , the length of the string. 
Next line will contain as string of length N. 
Next line will will contain Q , the number of queries. Then Q subsequent lines will contain two lowercase characters X and Y separated by a space.

Output:
For each query , output the answer in a separate line.   

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^3

SAMPLE INPUT
5
aacbb
2
a c
a b

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
4

Explanation

For the first query, the possible substrings are aac and ac . Hence the answer is 2. 
For the second query, the possible substrings are aacbb  ,  aacb ,  acbb , and acb , hence making a total of 4 substrings.
