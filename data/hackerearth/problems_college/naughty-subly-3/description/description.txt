Subly is a very naughty kid. His father gave a set of numbers to him. In the set no number is repeated and the set has N elements. He wanted Subly to keep that set safe. When his Father was busy watching a new season of his favourite TV series, Subly became bored.  He started playing with the set of numbers that his father gave. He observed that he didn't like a few of the numbers in the set. So, he changed all numbers that he doesn't like to the number that he likes and is in the Set. 

When his father came to know about this, he got very angry. He wants to find the numbers of elements that his son changed. But he also wants to continue watching the Series, as his favourite character is kidnapped and the plot is getting very exciting.
