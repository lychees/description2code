The russian intelligence agency KGB make an encryption technique to send their passwords. Originally the password is of 3 characters. After encryption the password is converted into 3 numbers A-B-C.

Now, Sherlock wants to decrypt the password encryption technique of KGB. Sherlock knows that every number  has only 2 possible values which are following:

†POSSIBLE VALUES OF "A":‡   K, X

†POSSIBLE VALUES OF "B":‡   G, Y

†POSSIBLE VALUES OF "C":‡   B, Z

Help Sherlock to detect the encryption technique of the KGB and tell him the original password.

†INPUT:‡

The first line consist number of test cases †T‡ followed by †T‡ lines, each line consist of 3 space separated integers †A, B, C‡.

†OUTPUT‡

Print the correct message in format of †C-C-C‡

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 50000

1 ≤ †A, B, C‡ ≤ 1000000000

SAMPLE INPUT
2
27 25 4
25 26 16

SAMPLE OUTPUT
K-G-B
X-Y-B

Explanation

For test case 1, the password sent is 27-25-4, then 27 can be either 'K' or 'X', similar case for 25 & 4. After applying the encryption 27 is converted into K, 25 is converted into G and 4 is converted into B.
