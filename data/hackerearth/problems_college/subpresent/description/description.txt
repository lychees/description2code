It's India vs Pakistan and all the tickets of the match have been sold out.
Chotu being a die-hard fan participates in a lucky draw contest to win a ticket to the match.
The Rules of Contest are ->
The contest Organizers give a base string B and a lucky number K.
There are T rounds.
In each round Chotu is given a random string S, Chotu wins the round if the String S is a subsequence of the base String B
Chotu wins the ticket to the match if he wins atleast K rounds. 

Help Chotu find out if he will win the lucky draw or not.
Note- Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence (A,B,D) is a subsequence of  (A,B,C,D,E,F)  obtained after removal of elements C, E, and F. 

Input
First line of input contains a String B and an integer K.
Next line contains an integer T denoting the number of rounds.
Each of next T lines contain a string S. 
 
Output
Print the number of wins followed by "LUCKY" if Chotu wins the ticket ( number of wins is more than or equal to K) or "UNLUCKY" otherwise (without quotes).
Note - Print number of wins with both "LUCKY" and "UNLUCKY".

Constraints
1 ≤ |B| ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ 100

SAMPLE INPUT
abcd 1
2
ca
bd

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1 LUCKY

Explanation

The string of 1st round ca is not a subsequence of the base string
The string of 2nd round bd is a subsequence of the base string

So total rounds that Chotu win is 1, since the number is equal to the lucky number, so Chotu is lucky for the given draw.
