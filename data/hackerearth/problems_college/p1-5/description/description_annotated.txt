Alice was asked to construct a triangle ABC by her teacher.Her Teacher gives 3 random lenghths for AB,AC and MEDIAN AD.She notices that for some lengths she was unable to construct. So she asks you help if she can construct a triangle ABC with give values.

Input :

first line conatins number of test case “T” and then T lines follows.

Each test case has three integers x,y,z the lengths of sides AB,AC and AD respectively.

Output:

for each test case print “YES” if she can construct or “NO” if its impossible to .

constraints :

1 ≤T≤ 10^5.

1 ≤AB,AC,AD≤ 10^9.
