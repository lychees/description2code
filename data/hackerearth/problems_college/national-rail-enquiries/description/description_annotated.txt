Since the Annual Tech Fest of MAIT is coming, Hasan has decided to set up a lottery stall for the event. He makes several Tokens with a number written on it. The criteria for a number to be winning number is that the product of all the proper fractions with number as the denominator must be a fraction such that the numerator and denominator are relatively co-prime. Numerator can be very large so they should be modulo 110. Consider that more than one token can be a winning token. You have to help Hasan in finding out that whether a token is a winning token or not.

†Input:‡ The first line of input will be an integer t denoting number of test cases. The next t lines will contain an integer n denoting the number on token.

†Output:‡ The output must be of the form Case #: followed by either "Yes" or "No" denoting whether a token is a winning token or not.

†Constraints:‡ 1<T ≤ 10^5

1<n ≤ 10^12
