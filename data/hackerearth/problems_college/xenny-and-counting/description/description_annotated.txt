Xynazog was playing a game. He needed to score †k‡ points and he could play at most †N‡ moves and at least 1 move. In each move, he could get †[0,k]‡ points. Note: the number of points gained is always an integer.

Xynazog's friend PowerShell challenged Xenny to find the †number of ways‡ in which he could score k points in exactly N moves as per the given rules.

†Input Format:‡

First line contains a natural no. T, denoting the no. of testcases.
Each of the following T lines contains 2 space-separated integers N and k.

†Output Format:‡

Output the answer to each testcase on a new line.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

1 ≤ N,k ≤ 19

SAMPLE INPUT

2 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3

Explanation

Given k=2

k = 2 + 0
k = 0 + 2
k = 1 + 1
