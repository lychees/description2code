Its Sparsh(Techno-cultural fest of SVNIT) time and committee of Sparsh is  getting ready in making college look clean and green ( :p ). As a part of it, they are decorating departments and roads of SVNIT with plant pots available in nursery of college.

There are †N‡ plant pots available in nursery placed in a straight line. Sparsh committee is planning to take few of these pots to keep in different places all over campus. But as nursery also being favorite place of love birds in college, the committee members do not want the nursery to look empty. So they thought that whatever number of pots they are going to take, they will take no two successive pots.(i.e. if they are taking a pot i from nursery, they will not take i-1 and i+1 pots.)

So given N, calculate how many different set of pots they could select. They need to take at least one pot from nursery.
†Input:‡
First line contains number of test cases T.
Next T lines contain a single integer N each.

†Output:‡
Print answer for each test case modulo 10^9 + 7. For each test case print in a new line.

†Constraints:‡
1 < T < 1000000
2 < N < 1000000
