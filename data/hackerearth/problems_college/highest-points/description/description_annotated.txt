As the league stage of the world cup has come to its end, its time to calculate the highest points earned in the league stage by a team. 
There are many teams playing in the world cup. A team is awarded †3‡ points for a win, †1‡ point for a tie and it †loses 1‡ point if they lose a match.  You have received data of †N‡  teams and have been assigned the duty to calculate the highest point earned by a team among the †N‡  teams in the league stage. For each team, data contains three integers – †W‡ ( number of wins), †T‡ (number of tie), †L‡ (number of matches the team lost).  Now, calculate the highest points earned by a team in the league stage among the †N‡ teams.
†INPUT:‡
First line contains a integer †N‡, number of teams.
 Next †N‡ lines contains three integers separated by space :  †W T L‡ , number of wins, tie, lost matches for that †ith‡ team. (1 ≤ i ≤ N)
†OUTPUT:‡
print a single integer , highest points earned a team among the †N‡ teams.

†CONSTRAINS‡
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ W,T,L ≤ 100

SAMPLE INPUT
3
3 0 1
2 1 3
1 1 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
8

Explanation

Team 1 =  (3x3) + (0x1) + (1x-1) = †8‡
Team 2 = (2x3) + (1x1) + (3x-1) = 4
Team 3 = (1x3)  +  (1x1)  +  (1x-1) = 3
So the highest point earned by any team is †8‡.
