You and Your friend play BADMINTON together. Each game of BADMINTON ends in one of two ways -- win, lose. you Both have been playing for many years, but suddenly your friend starts boasting around that how good a player he is. He claims to have so far played G games in total and D games today (obviously, G ≥ D).

At the end of the day, You look at the game statistics to see how well he has played. It turns out that he has won exactly PD percent of the D games today, and exactly PG percent of G total games he had ever played. No rounding is required -- All 2 percentages are integers B/w 0 and 100 ! Since, He doesn't remember the exact no. of games that he has played today (D), or the exact number of games that he has played in total (G).  But you know that he could not have played more than N games today (D = N).

Now you have to testify his claim ,that whether he has his statistics right or wrong

Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line contains 3 int -- N (max Number of games he claims to played today, D ≤ N), PD( percentage od games won today )  and PG (percentage of games won in total).

Output

For each test case, output one line containing "#x:y", where x is the case number which is being solved (starting from 1) and y is your solution to that case either "Possible" if his claim is true or "Broken" if his claim is false.
Limits

0 ≤ PD ≤ 100;
0 ≤ PG ≤ 100.

†dataset‡

1 ≤ T ≤ 2000;
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^15.

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 100 50
10 10 100
9 80 56

SAMPLE OUTPUT
#1:Possible
#2:Broken
#3:Possible

Explanation

3,
N = 5
D = 5
G = 25
PD = 80
PG = 56
won 4 today (80% of D)
won 14 in total (56% of G)
Hence Possible
