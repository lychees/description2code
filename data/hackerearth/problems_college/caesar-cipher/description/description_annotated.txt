Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption technique.
To encrypt a message, we shift the alphabets of the message by a fixed position or key. 

For example, if message is †ABC‡ , and we shift each character by 3 characters, we will get  †DEF‡. Here key is 3.

Given a message and key , compute its Caesar Cipher.

Input
First line contains †t‡ - number of test cases.
2* †t‡ lines follow

First line of each test case contains †k‡, the key of the Cipher.

Second line of each test case contains the message

Output
Print encrypted message for each test case in a separate line.

Constraints
