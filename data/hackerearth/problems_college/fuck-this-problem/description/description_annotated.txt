Gang members are sitting in the other part of the city, far away from the bomb site. They are controlling the bomb by sending the activation signal in the form of encrypted code.The Enigma crew has found the solution for the encrypted code. They came to know that the code is in the form of string S. Dividing the string up to its length L into many substrings of length N will give them the location of the bomb site.

Your job is to help the Enigma crew in finding the decrypted code. So, they can track the bomb site.

†Input Format‡
The first line contain a string S.
In the second line integer N the length of the substring is given.

†Output Format‡
Output line contain the total number of substrings each in new line.
