Darshak (Dark) was playing with numbers and started learning various concepts of prime numbers, composite numbers...

One day he got bored solving problems of easy level so he started searching new concepts and end up reading about relative primes...

So he want you to help me design a program which takes two numbers '†p‡' & '†q‡' and decides whether they are mutually primes or not.

Mutually primes means nothing but "Co-Primes".

†Input:‡

First line contains '†t‡' number of test cases, each line contains two numbers '†p'‡ and '†q‡'.

†Output:‡

If they are mutually prime then print "Is a Co-Prime"  and if not found then print "Not a Co-Prime".

Constraints:

1 ≤ t ≤ 5*10^3

1 ≤ p,q ≤ 10^18

SAMPLE INPUT
2
5 32
6 12

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Is a Co-Prime
Not a Co-Prime
