    saurons eye power on current day is equal to 3 time to its power on
    previous day minus the power on a day before previous day.

    Now Gandalf ask Frodo to give him the power of the Saurons Eye on nth day, but poor Frodo is not
    good in mathematics so he ask for help from you.
    Given the nth day you have to give Frodo power of Saurons eye on 
    that day mod 10^9 + 7.
    
Note You can assume the power of sauron eye is 1 on 1st day 
     and 3 on 2nd day.
Input
