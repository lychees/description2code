Consider an NXN matrix on which the possible moves from a given block (i,j), is either †one upward‡ (i+1, j), or †one rightward‡ (i, j+1) or †one  diagonally up‡ (i+1, j+1). 
As shown in figure:
  

assuming that the numbering of rows and columns starts from 1.

You have to tell number of ways one can reach from block [a][b] to block [c][d]. 
Since this number may be huge print your answer modulo 1000000007.  

†Input:‡

     First line T, the number of test cases

     T lines containing four space separated integers a,b,c,d.

†Output:‡

      T lines with required answer Modulo 1000000007 for each test case.

†Constraints:‡

      1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

      1 ≤ a ,b ≤ c,d ≤ 1004
