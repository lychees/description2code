As usual Alice and bob are playing a game. Alice will always take the first turn, after which they will take alternate turns and player who won't be able to make a move in 
his/her turn will loose the game. In starting Alice will be given number 'n'. A player in his turn can decrease the number given to him by either 'a' or 'b'(a and b are 
explained in last), after that he will give the resulted number 'x' ('x' is the resulted number after decreasing) to other player. Then other player will similarly 
decrease the number given to him by 'a' or 'b'. So a player in his/her turn have to perform two operations, first calculate the value of 'a' and 'b' for the number and 
then decrease the number either by 'a' or 'b'. Both alice and bob hate negative numbers, they also don't like positive numbers having one digit only. So they have 
to keep the number of digits in number at least 2 means they can't make the number less than 10. The player who won't be able to make a move in his turn will loose 
the game. Given the starting  number 'n' , you have to tell the winner of game assuming both players play optimally.

a: For a given number 'x', 'a' is number of prime numbers i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ x and gcd(i,x)=i. For example if player is holding 12 currently then 'a' is 2 (The numbers
satisfying the criteria are 2 and 3)

b: For a given number 'x', number of numbers i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ x and gcd(i,x)=1. For exmaple if player is holding 12 currently then 'b' is 4 ( The numbers satisfying 
the criteria are 1,5,7,11).

Input: First line will contain 't', no of test cases. After that there will be 't' lines each containging an integer 'n'.

Output: For each test case you have to print the winner of the game, "Alice" or "Bob" (without quotes).

Constraints:
