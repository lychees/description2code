Vishu has a packet of single digit "1". After experimenting on it, Vishu found a weird property of the packet that is whenever he tosses the packet in the air then each digit "1" present in the packet changed to digit "0" and each digit "0" present in the packet changed to "01". 

Vishu found it interesting and immediately asked a question to deepika : "How many 1's and 0's will be in the packet if she tosses the packet M times ?"

Input :

The first line contains the number of test cases T . Each test case consists of a positive integer - M .

Output :

For each test case output two space-separated integers, number of 1's and number of 0's in the packet after M tosses.

Constraints :

1 ≤ T ≤20

1 ≤ M ≤90
