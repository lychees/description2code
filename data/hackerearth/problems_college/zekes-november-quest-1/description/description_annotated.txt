Zeke is having a winter break. He has decided to take a task of evaluating certain strings. These strings have a specialty and hence is called Zekindrome. It is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. If there are odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for Zekindrome. 
Zeke is finding it difficult to think of a solution to find out Zekindromes.
Hence, he needs your help to find out the Zekindromes for him. 

†Input:‡

First line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test is a single line containing a string S composed of only lowercase characters.

†Output:‡

For each test case, output on a separate line: "YES" if the string is a Zekindrome and "NO" if it is not.
†Constraints:‡

    1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3
    2 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^3, where |S| denotes the length of S
