Adarsh likes divisibility very much  , but this time he wants to test his capability.
He gave himself a number †N‡ and tried to find the †smallest‡ number which is completely divisible by all numbers from 1 to N(inclusive).
As the result can be very large he  prints his answer †modulo‡ 10^9+7.

Input:

First line contain positive integer T (number of test cases).
Next T lines contains a number N.

Output:

Print T lines of output according to given problem.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ N ≤ 500000
