Two sweet dogs, Bernard and Havanese, play the following game.
There are †P‡ sticks, each of exactly †Q‡ meters in length. The dogs move in turns. For each move a dog chooses a stick and splits it into †two or more‡ equal parts each having integer length †greater than or equal‡ to †S‡ meters. Each resulting part is also a stick. The dog that can't make a move loses. Thus, the other dog wins.
Bernard makes the first move. Now you have to determine the winner if players play in the optimal way.

Input
First line of Input contains number of test cases †T‡. Each test case contains three integers †P, Q‡ and †S‡.

Output
For each test case print "Bernard", if Bernard wins, or "Havanese", if Havanese wins. You should print everything without the quotes.

†Constraint‡: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ P,Q,S ≤ 10^9
