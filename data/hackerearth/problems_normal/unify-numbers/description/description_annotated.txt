Today Omar has assignment problems from his math professor. Yes, Omar has infinite number of questions that he must solve today. The first problem went something like this.  

Given †N‡ integers in the form of †A_i‡ where †1 ≤ i ≤ N‡, Omar wants to make each number †A_i‡ in the †N‡ numbers equal to †M‡. To convert a number †A_i‡ to †M‡, it will cost †|M - A_i|‡ units. The problem asks to find out the minimum cost to convert all the †N‡ numbers to †M‡, so you should choose the best †M‡ to get the minimum cost. 

Omar gets bored easily from these kind of questions, can you solve it for him ?

†Input:‡ 

First line of the input contains an integer †T‡ denoting the number of test cases. 
First line of every test-case contains an integer †N‡.      
Second line of every test case contains †N‡ space separated integers †A_i‡.

†Output:‡ 

For each case, print the minimum cost that Omar needs to pay to convert each †A_i‡ to †M‡, in a separate line.   

†Constraints:‡

†1 ≤ T ≤ 10‡.
†1 ≤ N ≤ 10 ^ 5‡.
†1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^{9}‡

Explanation

One of the best †M's‡ you could choose in this case is †3‡.   
So the answer = †|1 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |4 - 3| + |5 - 3| = 6‡.
