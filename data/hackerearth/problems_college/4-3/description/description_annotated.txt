the ghost(shaggy) will make scooby's way out only if he answers the following problem. 
since scooby is not a nerd help him get out of the cave. the question is as follows.
Given a set S .
value of subset of s is sum of numbers in that subset.
Find sum of value of all subsets mod 10^9+7. 

Note :- value of null set is 0

Input 

first line contains T . no of test cases 

first line of every test cases is n (set size) 

second line of every test cases contains n numbers of the set  x(i).

Output 

print on a new line sum of value of all subsets of S mod 10^9+7 for each test case

†Constraint‡ 

0 < T < 10

0 < n ≤ 100

0 ≤ x(i) ≤ 100000

SAMPLE INPUT
1
3
1 2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
24

Explanation

for set {1,2,3}

posssible subsets are {1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}

sum of value of all subset is 24
