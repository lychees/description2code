Today is the first class after a long vacation and as always Bagha woke up late. His friend, Nathumama has a motorcycle which they can use to reach class on time. However, Nathumama doesn't have enough fuel to reach class so Bagha makes a magic machine which can regenerate the fuel after travelling for some kilometers. (Sorry, Law of Conservation of Energy ;D)
Nathumama's motorcycle has initially n liters of fuel. It takes 1 liter of fuel to travel 2 kilometers. The machine can recover 2 liters of fuel after travelling for 6 kilometers. Help, Bagha to determine if his machine can help him and Nathumama to reach class without getting their fuel exhausted.

†Input Format:‡
First line of input will contain the number of test cases †T‡.
Next T  lines of input will consist two integers †N‡ and †D‡ where N denotes liters initially in the motorcycle and D denotes the distance between class and hostel.

†Output Format:‡
The only line of output per test case will consist of "Yes" if Bagha and Nathumama can reach class else output "No".

†Note :‡
Bagha can only gain 2 liters of fuel by travelling 6 kilometers. He cannot gain 1 liter by travelling 3 kilometers i.e 2 liters is lowest amount of fuel that could be recovered.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
0 ≤ N,D ≤ 100

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Yes
No

Explanation

For first test case, Nathumama has 3 liters of fuel. They travel for 6 kilometers and waste 3 liters of fuel but at the same time generate 2 more liters. They have now 2 liters still left which they can use to travel 4 more kilometers and hence reach the class.
