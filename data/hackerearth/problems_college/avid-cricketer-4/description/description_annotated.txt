Debanjan challenges Utkarsh to play India vs Australia, and to defeat Australia in Legend Mode. Utkarsh has accepted the challenge and now faces a task to score "R" runs from "B" balls. Can you tell us the probability of Utkarsh winning the match if :

Every event is equiprobable.

The events are : {W,0,1,2,3,4,6}.

Note : Assume you have infinite wickets!

†Input format:‡

First line contains T , the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains "R" , the number of runs required and "B" , the number of balls left.

†Output format:‡

For every test case T , print the expected number of runs scored. Output should have exactly 6 decimal place precision.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ R ≤ 1000

1 ≤ B ≤ 1000

SAMPLE INPUT

1 1
2 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
0.714286
0.571429
