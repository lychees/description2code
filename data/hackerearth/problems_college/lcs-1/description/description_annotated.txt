Biswa and Debu are playing a weird word game. Biswa has a set S of N strings. Debu makes Q turns. In each turn he gives Biswa a string T. 
In each turn, Biswa's task is to find the longest substring of T which is also a substring in one of the strings in S.
 
Note: You can find the definition of substring here. 

Input

 The first line contains a single integer N
 Next N lines describe the strings in S. Each line contains a single string
 Next line contains a single integer Q
 Next Q line contain one string each

Output

For each turn, you need to output a single integer which is the answer to that turn in a new line

Constraints

 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
 Sum of lengths of all the strings in S ≤ 2 * 10^5
 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^3
 Sum of lengths of the strings over all turns ≤ 2 * 10^5
 All the strings contain only lowercase English alphabets
