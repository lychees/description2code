Find the number of pairs of non negative integers(n,m),such that 1 ≤ n<m ≤ k, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000000 and n|m^2 - 1 and m|n^2 - 1 ?

For integers m and n, it is said that m divides n, m is a divisor of n, or n is a multiple of m, and this is written as m | n,

Input :

first line conatins number of test case “T” and then T lines follows.
Each test case contains one integer "k".

Output:

For each test case print the number of pairs of non negative integers(n,m).

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

2 ≤ k ≤ 1000000
