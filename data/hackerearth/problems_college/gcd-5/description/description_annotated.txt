In this problem you will be given an integer array A of size N, your task is find whether given array is sorted or not (in ascending order) , if print "YES" else print "NO". 

Array a[n] is sorted if  a[0] ≤ a[1] ≤ ... a[n - 1].

Input

First line of input contains contains integer T denoting number of test cases. 
For each test case T, first line of input contains number N denoting size of array A and second line contains N space seperated integers denoting elements of array A.

Output

Print "YES" or "NO" as explained above.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000

1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10,00,00,00,000
