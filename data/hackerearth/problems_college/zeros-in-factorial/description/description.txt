Ram was busy calclutaing the factorials of some numbers. He saw a pattern in the number of zeros in the end of the factorial.
Let n be the number and Z(n) be the number of zeros in the end of the factorial of n then for 
x < y 

Z (x) ≤ Z(y)
i.e. the function never decreases.

He is solving a problem and wants to calculate the sum of number of zeros in the end of factorial of numbers in the range [a,b] i,e, sum of the number of zeros in the end for the factorial for all numbers 'n' such that the number n ≤ b and n ≥ a. But n can be very large and he don`t want to solve the problem by himself and he has asked you to solve the problem. Help him to solve the problem.

Constraints:

T ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ a,b ≤ 10^6

Input :

First line contains T number of test cases.

Then T lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.

Output :

T lines each containing the sum of number of zeros for the numbers in range [a,b]
