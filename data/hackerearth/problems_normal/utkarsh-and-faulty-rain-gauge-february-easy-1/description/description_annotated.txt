Utkarsh is going to †Cherrapunji‡ to visit his brother Saharsh. †Cherrapunji‡ faces one of largest rainfall in the country. So, Saharsh and Utkarsh decided to measure this rainfall by †T Rain Gauges‡. They were going to measure it by taking the †product‡ of the readings of all the gauges. But, they found out that the gauges were not working properly and were producing random values. The brothers want to know what will be the †expected result‡ of the experiment.

The †i^th Rain Gauge‡ has a least count of †1/Ri‡ units. It has †Ni‡ divisions on its surface. Formally, it can give any reading from the set †{0, 1/Ri , 2/Ri , ... ,Ni/Ri}‡. It gives a reading †x‡ with a probability proportional to †x^2‡. 
†Input Format:‡
The first line contains the integer †T‡.
†T‡ lines follow each containing †2‡ integers - †Ni‡ and †Ri‡.  
†Output format:‡
Print the answer to the problem as real number †exactly 4‡ decimal places. It is guaranteed that the answer is always less than †10^9‡.
†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^3
1 ≤ †Ni‡ ≤ 10^3 
1 ≤ †Ri‡ ≤ 10^3

†NOTE:‡ 
 A function †p(x)‡ is said to be proportional to  †x^2‡ means †p(x) = ax^2‡ for some non negative †a‡.
All the rain gauges produce values †independently‡ from each other.

Explanation

First gauge produces output 
1/4 with probability = 0.2
2/4 with probability = 0.8  

Second gauge produces output 
1/5 with probability = 0.2
2/5 with probability = 0.8

The product is 1/4 * 1/5 ( = 0.05) with a probability of 0.2 * 0.2 ( = 0.04)
The product is 1/4 * 2/5 ( = 0.1) with a probability of 0.2 * 0.8 ( = 0.16)
The product is 2/4 * 1/5 ( = 0.1) with a probability of 0.8 * 0.2 ( = 0.16)
The product is 2/4 * 2/5 ( = 0.2) with a probability of 0.8 * 0.8 ( = 0.64)

Therefore the result is 
0.05 with probability = 0.04  
0.1 with probability = .016+0.16 = 0.32  
0.2 with probability = 0.64  

The Expected Result is therefore = 0.05 * 0.04 + 0.1 * 0.32 + 0.2 * 0.64 = 0.1620
