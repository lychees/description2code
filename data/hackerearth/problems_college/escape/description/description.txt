Bran was a prisoner in Azkaban. Though Bran was a witty and intelligent guy.He was confident of escaping prison.After few days of observation,he figured out that the prison consists of (N × N) cells .i.e The shape of prison was (N × N) matrix. Few of the cells of the prison contained motion detectors.So Bran planned that while escaping the prison he will avoid those cells containing motion detectors.Yet before executing his plan,Bran wants to know the total number of unique possible paths which he can take to escape the prison.Initially Bran is in cell (1,1) while the exit of the cell (N,N).

Note:Bran can move in all four direction.If his current location is (X,Y), he can move to either (X+1,Y), (X-1,Y), (X,Y+1), (X,Y-1) }. If the first cell (1,1) and the last cell(N,N) contain motion detectors,then Bran can't break out of the prison.

Input Format:

The first line contain number of test cases T. The first line of each test case contains an integer "N",(i.e the size of the (N × N) matrix).The next n lines contain N space separated values either 0 or 1."1" represents a cell containing motion detectors.

Output Format:

Print total number of possible unique paths through which he can escape.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 20

1 ≤ N ≤ 20
