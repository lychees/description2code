Its Diwali time and little Roy thought of an interesting design for Rangoli.
He created an N x N grid. Roy fills some of the cells of grid with red color.

Cell located at ith row and jth column is colored if i+j is prime. Consider Zero-based numbering of grid. (See Sample Test Case Explanation for clarification)

Roy wants to know how many cells he will have to color given the size of grid N.

Input:

One integer indicating size of grid N

Output:

Print a single integer, number of cells Roy will have to color. Since answer can be very large output it modulo 1000000007

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤1000000

5

Explanation

As shown in the image above, five cells (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are colored red because for (i,j) i+j for these cells results into a prime number.
