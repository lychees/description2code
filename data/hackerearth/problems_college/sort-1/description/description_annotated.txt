The dark lord wants to send armies of imps to assault Hogwarts in the first wave of offense. The imps are accustomed to fight in communities and will not fight separately. Communities are sent to battle such that the size of each community sent must be greater than the previous community sent to increase pressure on Hogwarts. Suppose there are 'n' such communities and their may be 'x[i]' number of imps in each such community. The dark lord now asks for your help in laying siege to Hogwarts by arranging their numbers in order of their community size.

INPUT:
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines containing 'n'(the number of communities) and 'x[i]'(total no. of imps in the community)

OUTPUT:
For each test case print the community sizes arranged in the required order.

CONSTRAINTS:
0 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N ≤ 100000
0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100000000
