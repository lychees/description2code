You are provided a matrix of size N*N with source position at (0,0) and
destination at (N-1,N-1) in a 2D array. Some of the positions in the array are marked as 0 which are blocked cells, rest being marked 1. 

A path is a connected sequence of elements from (0,0) to (N-1,N-1) which consists of 1. A sequence of 1s in the 2D array is connected if every 1 in the sequence is adjacent (the above or left neighbour) to the next 1 in the sequence.

For example, in the following matrix,

'1'   '1'   0

0    '1'   '1'

1     0     '1'   

the 1s marked in quotes is a connected path from (0,0) to (2,2)

Note that cells at (0,0) and (N-1,N-1) are always 1. You can either make
movement towards right or down, i.e., from position (x,y), you can go to either the position (x,y+1) or (x+1,y).

Input

First line consists of the number of test cases and second line consist of size of the input array N ( â‰¤ 50), following that would
be the state of NxN maze which would consist of 0s and 1s.

Output

You have to print "POSSIBLE" if there exists a path between the source and the destination otherwise print "NOT POSSIBLE".
