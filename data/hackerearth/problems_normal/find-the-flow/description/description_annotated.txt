Given a directed flow network where each edge has a capacity of flow it could allow, find the maximum flow over the network from source(†S‡) to sink(†T‡).

Network will follow these rules:
Only one source(†S‡) and only one sink(†T‡).
Other than source and sink, nodes are represented with alphabets †[A-O]‡.
There are no self loops.
There will be no initial dead ends other than †T‡.
For any pair of nodes, direction of edges between them will be in single direction.

†Input Format:‡
First line has an integer †E‡- number of edges.
Next †E‡ lines have three values †V_i\;V_j\;C_x‡ which implies there is a node from †V_i‡ to †V_j‡ with capacity †C_x‡.

†Output Format:‡
Print a single integer which is the maximum flow from source to sink.

†Constraints:‡
†1 ≤ E ≤ 50‡
†1 ≤ C_x ≤ 50‡
Network includes †S‡, †T‡, a maximum of †15‡ other nodes.
