Given †K‡ prime numbers and †T‡ queries of form †Ai, Bi‡, for each query print the number of integers between †Ai‡ and †Bi‡ (both inclusive) that are divisible by atleast one of the †K‡ given primes.     

Input
First line: †K‡ and †T‡. 
Second line: †K‡ primes.
Next †T‡ lines, each contain †Ai, Bi‡.    

Output
Print †T‡ lines, denoting the answer to each of the †T‡ queries.

Constraints
