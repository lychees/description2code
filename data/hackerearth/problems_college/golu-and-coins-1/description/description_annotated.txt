Golu is given a task of clearing coins fallen down  on floor. Naughty being his modus operandi, he thought of playing a game while clearing coins. He arranges the coins like an †M X N matrix‡ with random †heads (1) and tails (0).‡

In every move, he chooses a sub-matrix of size †L X B [such that max(L,B) >1] and interchanges all heads to tails and vice-versa present in the chosen sub-matrix‡. Then if he finds a †2X2 sub-matrix exclusively of heads anywhere in the M X N matrix‡, he removes those coins.

Your task is simple. You have to report the minimum no. of moves taken by him before he clears his first †2X2 sub-matrix‡.

†Input:‡

Your first line of input consists of two numbers †M‡, †N‡. Each of the next †M lines consists of N space-separated integers which are either 0 or 1‡.

†Output:‡

Output a single line answer giving the minimum no. of steps taken before his first clearance. If it is impossible for him to do so, print "†-1‡" (quotes for clarity).

Constraints

2 ≤ †M,N‡ ≤ 10
