Each army fighting the world war Z is denoted with a word consisting any combination of 26 alphabets. An army is a match for his/her opponent if and only if his name is an anagram of his/her opponent. Your job as a programmer is to help find whether two randomly selected members are match for each other or not.

(An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Your task is to find whether a given pair of words is anagrams to each other.
 Eg: Silent is anagram to listen.)
