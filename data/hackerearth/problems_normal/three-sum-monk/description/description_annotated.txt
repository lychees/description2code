This time, there will be no unnecessary information in the problem statement.

Given an array(†A‡) of †N‡ integers, find the probability that sum of any selected triplet is a cube of an integer number.

A triplet is a set of any three indices. Two triplets with same indices but in different order are considered same (†Ex:‡ triplets with indices {2,4,5} and {2,5,4} are same).

Cube of a number x is †x * x * x‡.

†Input:‡ 

First line has an integer †T‡=number of test cases.
Each test case has two lines.
First line of test case has an integer †N‡=numbers in the array.
Second line of test case has an array of †N‡ integers.

†Output:‡

Print answer for each test case in a separate lines with †exactly 9 decimal digits‡.  

†Constraints:‡ 

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 40
3 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 500
1 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 2000

Explanation

†Case #1 :‡ No triplet sum could be cube of an integer.

†Case #2 :‡ We can form 4 triplets.

Indices        Values       Sum  
{1,2,3}        {1,1, 6}    1+1+6 = 8  
{1,2,4}        {1,1,25}    1+1+25 = 27  
{1,3,4}        {1,6,25}    1+6+25 = 32
{2,3,4}        {1,6,25}    1+6+25 = 32

Out of 4 resulting sums, 2 are cube of a number and therefore probability is 2/4.
