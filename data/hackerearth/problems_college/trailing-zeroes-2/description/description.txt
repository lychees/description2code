Let there be a function f(N) such that f(N) denotes number of zeroes at the end of N! (factorial of N).

For example, f(5) = 1 because 5! = 120.

You have to compute f(N) for given N.

Input format : Input begins with integer t  ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) denoting number of test cases. Then there are t lines each containing exactly one positive integer 0< N <10000000 

Output format : print f(N)
