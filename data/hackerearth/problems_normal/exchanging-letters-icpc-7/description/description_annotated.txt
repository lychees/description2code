There are †n+2‡ people sitting in a line, numbered from †0‡ to †n+1‡. Some †K distinct‡ people with numbers ranging between †1‡ and †n‡ (inclusive) have letters given to them. The role of people with letters is to give their letters to one person sitting adjacent to them. At the end of this procedure, let †X‡ denote the sum of the numbers of all the people who have letters.  Find the number of possible ways that †X‡ can equal a given number, †T‡, modulo †10^9 + 7‡. 

†Note, if a person has two letters, count him/her twice.‡

†Input:‡

The first line contains three integers, †N‡, †K‡, and †T‡, in that order. 

Next line consists of †K‡ integers, the numbers of the people who have letters. 

†Output:‡

Output the answer to the problem.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ N ≤ 2000
1 ≤ K ≤ 2000
1 ≤ T ≤ 4000000
1 ≤ Number of everyone who has a letter ≤ N

SAMPLE INPUT
3 1 1
2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1

Explanation

In order for this to work, person 2 must pass the letter to person 1.  So, there is exactly 1 way.
