You are given an equation in  x and y variables of the form †x^p + x + y^q = K‡. You are required to find out the total number of  possible non-negative †integral‡ solutions for this equation given †p‡, †q‡ and †K‡ as input. A solution is a pair of non-negative integers (x, y) that satisfies the above equation. 
†Input Format :‡
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, †T‡. †T‡ test cases follow. Each test case starts with one line with three integers: †p‡, †q‡ and †K‡.

†Output Format:‡
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x:", where x is the test case number (starting from 1). Then, for every test case, output the number of solutions to the equation satisfying the constraints. 
†Constraints:‡
†p‡, †q‡ and †K‡ are positive  integers.

0 < †T‡ ≤ 20

2 ≤ †p‡, †q‡ ≤ 10

0 < †K‡ ≤ 10^14

SAMPLE INPUT
2   
2 2 4
2 2 2016

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 2

Explanation

For the †first‡ test-case, the equation is †x^2 + x + y^2 = 4‡. †x=0, y=2‡ is the only possible solution satisfying the constraints.

For the †second‡ test-case, the equation is †x^2 + x + y^2 = 2016‡. There are two possible solutions where †x‡ and †y‡ are non-negative integers: †x=31, y=32‡ and †x=44, y=6‡.
