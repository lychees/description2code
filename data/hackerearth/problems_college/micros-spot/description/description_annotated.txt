Micro loves watching Big Bang Theory and his favorite character is Sheldon. Just like Sheldon he also wants his spot, so he divided his room into an †N*M‡ matrix. He then assigned two numbers to each cell. †A[i][j]‡ denotes first number he assigned to cell (i,j) and †B[i][j]‡ denotes second number he assigned to cell (i,j). Micro loves a cell (i,j), and calls it Micro's Spot, if value of †B[i][j]‡ is maximum in i^th row and †A[i][j]‡ is maximum in j^th column. Help find total number of Micro's Spot.

†Input:‡
First line consists of an integer †T‡ denoting number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting †N‡ and †M‡. Then †2N‡ lines follow each containing †M‡ space separated integers. First †N‡ lines denote matrix †A‡ and following †N‡ lines denote matrix †B‡.

†Output:‡
Print the answer to each test case in a new line.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †N‡, †M‡ ≤ 1000 
0 ≤ †A[i][j], B[i][j]‡ ≤ 10^9
