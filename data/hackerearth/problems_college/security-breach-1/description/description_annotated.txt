†Statement‡: Security is the major factor, which is prohibiting hackers letting into bank accounts online. But still, we have breached 2nd level security of †SBIS‡ bank and a final level is kept for you. Your task is simple, we are receiving an integer token every time we try to send an authorization request. After analysing the integer value, we came to know that after decrypting it, we get  a key to †SBIS‡ login credential database.

†How to decrypt‡:  If the integer token contains {2,7,6,9}, print the keys accordingly and skip other digits. If none of the digits from the above set is available, print an empty line.
2 = cde
7 = acf
6 = b3
9 = c6a

Input: First line of input contains total number of test cases, †T‡, followed by †T‡ lines each containing an integer token, †IT‡.

Output: †T‡ lines, each containing decrypted value.

Constraints: 1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100    |    1 ≤ †IT‡ ≤ 10^18

SAMPLE INPUT
1
23695632789

SAMPLE OUTPUT
cdeb3c6ab3cdeacfc6a

Explanation

In the sample input, number of test cases is 1 and the corresponding integer token is †23695632789‡.
From the given decrypting method, we get-
†2‡- cde
†6‡- b3
†9‡- c6a and so on.
So, the final output is †cdeb3c6ab3cdeacfc6a‡.
