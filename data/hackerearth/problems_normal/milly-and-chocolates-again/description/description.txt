Milly and Pranjul are playing a game in which Pranjul will give an index of a chocolate. Then, Milly has to tell him the box number in which that chocolate is in. There are N such boxes and Ci chocolates are there in i^th the box. Description of index is given below :

Suppose there are A1, A2 … AN chocolates in 1^st, 2^nd… N^th boxes respectively. So, indexing of chocolates in 1^st box will be from 1 to A1, similarly in 2^nd box indexing will be A1 + 1 to A2 … and indexing in N^th box will be from AN-1 + 1 to AN. 

Milly is blind folded so she can’t see the boxes. You are required to help her. 

Input

First line will contain N (No. of boxes). Next line will contain N space separated integers denoting Ci, the number of chocolates in i^th box.
Next line will contain Q (No. of times Pranjul will ask her). Then each next Q lines will contain the asked index I.

Output
For every query, print in a new line : the box number in which that index of chocolate is in.
Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Ci ≤ 10
1 ≤ ∑ Ci ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ I ≤ ∑ Ci
