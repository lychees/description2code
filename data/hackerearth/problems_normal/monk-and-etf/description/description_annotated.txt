Monk has been solving a lot of mathematical problems recently. He was learning †ETF‡ (Euler Totient Function) and found the topic quite interesting. So, he tried solving a question on †ETF‡. He will be given two numbers †L‡ and †R‡. He has to find the probability that the †ETF‡ of a number in the range [†L‡, †R‡] is divisible by a number †K‡.
Note:
†ETF‡ is an arithmetic function that counts the positive integers less than or equal to †N‡ that are relatively prime to †N‡. To learn more about †ETF‡, click here.

†Input:‡
The first line contains the number of test cases i.e. †T‡.
The next †T‡ lines will contain three integers †L‡, †R‡ and †K‡.

†Output:‡
Print the answer in a new line after rounding off the first 6 digits after the decimal place.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †L‡ ≤ †R‡ ≤ 10^12
0 ≤ †R‡ - †L‡ ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ †K‡ ≤ 10^6

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 4 2
2 5 2
3 10 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT
0.500000
0.750000
0.375000

Explanation

In Case 1:
ETF values of numbers from 1 to 4 are - 1, 1, 2, 2. Probability that ETF value is divisible by 2 is (2/4) = 0.5
In Case 2:
ETF values of numbers from 2 to 5 are - 1, 2, 2, 4. Probability that ETF value is divisible by 2 is (3/4) = 0.75
In Case 3:
ETF values of numbers from 3 to 10 are - 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4. Probability that ETF value is divisible by 4 is (3/8) = 0.375
