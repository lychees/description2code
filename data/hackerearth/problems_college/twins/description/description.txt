Ram loves those numbers which are square of any number. To check his love for these numbers one day Sham gives him two numbers a and p where p  is prime number and asks him if it is possible to find any square number which gives modulo a when divided by p. This task is difficult for Ram so he asks for your help. Help Ram to find whether such number exists or not.
