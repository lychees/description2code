Raghu wants to design a converter such that when a user inputs a binary number it gets converted to Octal number & also the correspond alphabet to it.

Example- if a user inputs- 10101101
then the output is 255 BEE

Note : for decimal places there should be a space between the alphabetic signs
Ex- for input  101101101110.111
output -5556.7 EEEF G

†A stands for 1, b for 2 , if the octal digit is 0 consider it as a space‡ 

SAMPLE INPUT
10101101

SAMPLE OUTPUT
255 BEE
