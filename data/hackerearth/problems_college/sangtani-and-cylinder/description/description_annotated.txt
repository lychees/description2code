My dear friend Sangtani is very excited with his holiday plans and was thinking about what to pack in his bag. As he likes namkeen very much he decided to pack some for the travel. For this he decided to pack namkeen in cylindrical containers. So he thought of buying some cans from the market. However he wanted the cans to have smallest surface area and greater volume.
As he is busy with Major preparation, he has asked you to help him. Your job is to calculate minimum surface area for a given volume. 

†Note:‡  Print Exactly nine digits after decimal point.

†Input:‡

First Line contain T, number of test cases.

Next T lines follow
Each line containing an integer, volume of the can.

†Output:‡

Contains exactly T lines
Each line containing required surface area.

†Constraint:‡

0 < Volume < 1000  

Note:
Volume of cylinder is V = (h * PI * R^2)
Surface Area of a cylinder is S = (2 * PI * R * (R + H))
PI is (2*acos(0.0)).

†Sample Input:‡

50

†Sample Output:‡

75.132507

SAMPLE INPUT
1
50

SAMPLE OUTPUT
75.132506983
