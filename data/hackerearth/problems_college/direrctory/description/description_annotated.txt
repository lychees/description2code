Lexicographical order is a generalization of the way the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters. An example of lexicographical arrangement is a dictionary or a contact directory.

You are given some names, and your task is to arrange these names in lexicographical order. The interesting part is that some of these names contain roman numerals at end like Louis IV and Henry VII. Take care of these roman numerals as well in correct mathematical order i.e. I<II<III,IV and so on.
