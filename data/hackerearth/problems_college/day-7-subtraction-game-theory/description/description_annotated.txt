†Problem :‡

Baba wants to kill Guruji. He has a master plan but Guruji is prepared for him.

Baba released a bacterial concentration of †1 unit‡ in Guruji's underground water source on Day 0. The concentration of bacteria becomes †x‡ times the concentration day before. But,Guruji's powder kills †y‡ units of bacteria each day, starting from Day 1.

Guruji needs your help to estimate the concentration of bacteria on the †N‡ th day. 

†Note : Large Input/Output Data. Use fast I/O.‡

Input

First line consists of 2 space separated integers †x‡ and †y‡. The next line consists of a single integer †Q‡, denoting the number of queries Guruji has for you. The next †Q‡ lines are such that each line consists of a single integer †N‡.

Output

For each query of Guruji, print the number of bacteria present on the †N‡ th day on a new line. Since the answer can be really huge, †print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7) .‡

Constraints

2 ≤ †x‡ ≤ 100

0 ≤ †y‡ ≤ (†x-2‡)

1 ≤ †Q‡ ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^6
