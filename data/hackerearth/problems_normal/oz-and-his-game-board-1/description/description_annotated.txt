Today Oz is playing with his game-board. He has ††N‡ coins† of ‡type-†1‡† and ‡†M‡ coins† of ‡type-†2‡†. Also the game-board has ‡†N‡ squares† of ‡type-†1‡† and ‡†M‡ squares† of ‡type-†2‡†. In this game Oz must place one coin into each square. After placing all coins Oz will get a score based on his coin placement strategy . 

His score calculation is like this : If type-‡1† square contains a type-‡1† coin then he will get ‡†A‡ points†, if type-‡2† square contains a type-‡2† coin then he will get ‡†B‡ points† and in all other cases, he will get ‡†C‡ points†.
Oz's total game score will be ‡sum of scores of all squares†. Help Oz to earn ‡maximum game points† with his game-board.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases ‡†T‡† . 

Each test case consists of five space separated integers - ‡†N, M, A, B‡† and ‡†C‡†. 

Output

For each test case output maximum game points that Oz can earn.

Constraints

‡1 ≤  T ≤ 100†

‡1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10†^‡9†

‡-10†^‡4† ‡ ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10†^‡4†

SAMPLE INPUT

1 5 10 -20 -30

SAMPLE OUTPUT
4700
-90

Explanation

For first sample :

With optimal strategy Oz will place ‡3† coins of type-‡1† into ‡3† squares of type-‡1† getting score ‡=500+500+500 = 1500†
and he will place ‡4† coins of type-‡2† into ‡4† squares of type-‡2† getting score = ‡800+800+800+800 = 3200†
so total score will be ‡1500+3200 =4700†
He cannot get better then this in any other coin placement strategy.
