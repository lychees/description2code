Rahul is assigned a task by his fellow mates.He has to take a string from somewhere and first of all he has to calculate the weight of that string.The weight of string is calculated by adding the ASCII values of each characters in that string and then dividing 
it with the total no of characters in that string.Then the weight of string is rounded off to previous integer.
           Now this weight of string is used to perform some tasks if the weight is odd then he has to print the character that is repeated maximum number of times in original string else he has to print the reverse of the whole string.

INPUT

First line inputs the string.

OUTPUT

According to the task the output is generated.

CONSRAINTS

length of string should be less than 100.

SAMPLE INPUT
Hello World

SAMPLE OUTPUT
l

Explanation
