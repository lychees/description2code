In this problem, you are given list of †N‡ numbers from 1 to N. They may be written in any order. You are to create a special list out of the given list. It should be such that the position of integer i is the i-th number in the given list. We will call this new list an inverse list. If the given list is an inverse list then you print "inverse", if not then "not inverse". (Quotes for clarity)

†Input:‡
The first line of input is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) .
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
Then a list of the integers from 1 to n follow in the next line.

†Output:‡
Print a single line of output for each test case.

SAMPLE INPUT
2
3
3 1 2
3
1 2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
not inverse
inverse

Explanation

For the first list [3 1 2], the inverse list formed would be [2 3 1].
