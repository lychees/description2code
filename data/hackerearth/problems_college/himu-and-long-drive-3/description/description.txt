Himu wants to go on a long drive with his girlfriend. There are N cities numbered from 1 to N, and every city is connected to every other city with bidirectional road. The length of a road is equal to XOR of the city numbers it is connecting. For example the length of road connecting city numbers 8 and 4 is 12. Himu wants this drive to be really long, so he will choose the road having maximum length. Help Himu find out the length of the longest road.

Input:
First line consists of T, the number of test cases.
Second line consists of N, the number of cities.

Output:
Print the answer for each test case in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9

SAMPLE INPUT
1
3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3

Explanation

There are 3 cities.
Length of road between city number 1 & 2 = 3
Length of road between city number 2 & 3 = 1
Length of road between city number 1 & 3 = 2
So, clearly the maximum road length is  3.
