Dr.Dawood is another mathematician who is more geekier than Osama (that's why, ++). Dawood deals with more complex problems than Osama usually deals with. He also recruits people to be his sub-ordinates. He usually gives them "trivial" problems as test for them to solve and earn their position to be his sub-ordinate. 

You went to attend such a test and you were given the following question.

Lets define a function †A(N,K)‡ where it signifies the number of ways in which we can draw K objects from a pool of N objects. 

Lets define another function †B(x1,x2,x3,x4,...)‡ where it signifies the largest integer which can perfectly divide all the integers x1,x2,x3,...

Using these two functions , Dawood gave you a problem. The problem is stated as follows..

Given an integer N find the value of the equation,
†O = B(A(2N,1),A(2N,3),A(2N,5),....,A(2N,(2*N)-1)‡
Input consists of †T‡ in the first line, which is the total number of testcases to be processed. Followed by †T lines of inputs‡. Each testcase consists of value †N‡.

Output the †value of the equation O‡ in a new line.

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 1000

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^12
