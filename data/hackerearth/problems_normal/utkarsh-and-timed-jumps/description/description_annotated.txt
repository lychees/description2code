Utkarsh lives in a strange country. The cities of the country are present on †x axis‡. He is currently at a city at †x = 0‡. He needs to reach another city at †x = N‡.
Utkarsh can move only in the positive x direction. Also due to massive traffic in the one dimensional country, at any time = T seconds, a person can make one of the following things.
Stay at his current position 
Make a jump of length †T‡. (i.e. move from †x = cur‡ to †x = cur+T‡)

You need to tell the minimum time Utkarsh will take to reach his destination.

†INPUT‡
First line contains an integer †T‡, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer †N‡ on separate line.

†OUTPUT‡
For each test case print the minimum time to reach the city at †x = N‡.

†CONSTRAINTS‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ †10^5‡ 
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ †10^{18}‡

Explanation

For testcases:
Stay at x=0 at time = 1; Move to x=2 at time = 2
Move to x=1 at time = 1; Move to x=3 at time = 2
