While Omar was studying for Math lectures, he found the following problem.  
Given †3‡ Integers †N_1‡, †N_2‡, †N_3‡, count the number of common divisors which divide all of them. 

Can you please help Omar in solving this problem, because he usually sleeps in lectures. 

†Input:‡ 

Given an integer †T‡, which indicates the number of test cases.
For each test case: given †3‡ separated integers †N_1, N_2, N_3‡.  

†Output:‡

For each test case: print the number of common divisors which divide †N_1, N_2, N_3‡. Print each case in a separate line. 

** Constraints:**  

†1 ≤ T ≤ 50‡  
†1 ≤ minimum\; (N_1, N_2 , N_3) ≤ 10 ^ {12}‡  
†1 ≤ maximum\; (N_1, N_2 , N_3) ≤ 10 ^ {18}‡
