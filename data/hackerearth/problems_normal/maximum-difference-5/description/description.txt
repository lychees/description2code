Given N space separated integers. Your task is to arrange them such that the summation M of the absolute differences between every two adjacent numbers is maximum.  

Input:

First line of the input contains an integer N.      
Second line contains N space separated integers A_i.   

Output:

Print the above described M. 

Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.
1 ≤ A_i  ≤ 10^{5}.

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 2 7

SAMPLE OUTPUT
11

Explanation

One of the best arrangements is (1,7,2), M = |1 - 7| + |7 - 2| = 11
