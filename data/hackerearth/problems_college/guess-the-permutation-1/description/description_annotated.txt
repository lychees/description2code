Lucifer is having a permutation of integers from 1 to †N‡ denoted by †P‡. Let †i^th‡ element of †P‡ be denoted as †Pi‡. For all pairs of distinct integers †i‡ and †j‡ between 1 to †N‡, he wrote the number †ai,j = min(pi, pj)‡. He writes †ai,i = 0‡.

Given all values of †ai,j‡, Lucifer wants you to find permutation †P‡.
 
Input 
First line contains integer †T‡(number of test cases) 
Next line contains integer †N‡.
Next †N‡ lines will contain the values †ai,j‡. †j^th‡ number on †i^th‡ line denotes †ai,j‡.The †i^th‡ number on the  †i^th‡ line will be 0. It's guaranteed that †ai,j = aj,i‡ and there is at least one solution consistent with the information given.

Output

If there are multiple solutions for the given input, print the permutation which is lexicographical smallest.

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 1000
