As we have seen our little Vaishanavi playing with the plywood, her brother Vaishnav was playing
with numbers. 

Read about Factorial 

As we all know this kid always thinks in a different way than others think. He have some numbers with him. He wants to find out that if he finds the factorial of the numbers that he have how many times his lucky numbers are there in the factorial. Indeed this is simple.

Please help our little Vaishnav. Because you are ready to help him he will tell you that he has 2 lucky numbers
that are '4' & '7'. So if the number is 6 factorial is 720. So the count is 1. Suppose you got the
factorial as 447(JUST IMAGINE) your answer will be 3.
