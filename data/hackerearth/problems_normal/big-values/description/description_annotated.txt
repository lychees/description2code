Arjun is a very good coder, but he is afraid of big numbers. He couldn't understand how to solve the questions with large numbers. And now he's stuck in a new question. Can you help him...

Given a number †N‡, you just need to calculate †C(N,6)‡, where C(n,r) is the no. of combinations of r items from n items.
C(n,r) = n!/(r! * (n-r)!)   where n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n and 0! = 1

6 ≤ †N‡<10^6

Since, the value computed would be very large, print your answer in †mod 10^9 + 7‡

†Input:‡

First and only line of input will take an integer †N‡.

†Output:‡

Print †C(N,6)‡ †mod 10^9 + 7‡

SAMPLE INPUT
6

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1

Explanation

C(6,6) = 6!/(6! * (6-6)!) = 6!/(6! * 0!) = 1
