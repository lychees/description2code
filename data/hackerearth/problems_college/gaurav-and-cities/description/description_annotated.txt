We all are aware of Gaurav and his love for "weird" recurrences.
Recently, he came up with another of his wierd recurrence namely the "12321" recurrence.
F(n)= 1 * F(n-1) + 2 * F(n-2) + 3 * F(n-3) + 2 * F(n-4) + 1 * F(n-5)
He intends to make the use of his new "weird" recurrence for his latest encryption technique. 
Rajat, an ethical hacker and a friend of Gaurav claimed that his encryption technique has loopholes and can be broken in no time.
To prove his claim, Rajat needs to find the Nth number of the sequence formed using the recursion as fast as possible.   

Using his knowledge of hacking, he was able to get some seed values of the recurrence that Gaurav intends to use in his encryption.
F(1)=1 
F(2)=2 
F(3)=3 
F(4)=2 
F(5)=1

Help Rajat hack Gaurav's recurrence by your programming skills. Your hack will decide the future of "Cryptography".
