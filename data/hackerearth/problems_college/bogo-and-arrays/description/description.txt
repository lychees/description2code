Bogo is a beginner in competitive programming . Now a days she is learning about arrays . One day while she was practicing she came up with a question .

The question was :

Given a array A = {Ai , Ai+1 ,Ai+2 , . . . An} . N (Natural numbers) .

First she would write all subarrays on a piece of paper and  then prepare a list  of all the maximum values present in each subarray . Ultimately she want’s to know that how many numbers in the list produced are greater than a given value K . As she is only a beginner in competitive programming so she wants your help to solve this for her .

Input :

The first Line of the test case consists of T(representing number of test cases) .
First line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and K .
N representing the number of elements and K as mentioned in the problem statement  .

The next line of each test case contains N space separated integers, each denoting 
element of array A .

Constraints :

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ N ≤ 2 x 10^5

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9

1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

Sum of N over all the test cases does not exceed 10^6

Output : For each test case print the required output in a separate line .
