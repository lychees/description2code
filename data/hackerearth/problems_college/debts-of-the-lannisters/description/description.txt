Tyrion, son of Tywin was released from the dungeons of vale after his champion Bronn defeated Ser Vardis in the trial by combat.

As a Lannister always pays his debts, he invited Bronn to play a game of mastermind with him.

The game is played as follows:

Tyrion has rocks of 7 colours. (As he is rich, he has infinitely many of each colour)
He makes a sequence of length 10 from these rocks.
The colours are: VIBGYOR (Each letter is associated to corresponding colour)

Now Bronn chooses the number of times he wants to play. (No. of test cases)
Then each time he has to guess a sequence of 10 rocks.
Based on each guess Tyrion rewards Bronn 1 gold coin for a rock which is correct in colour and position both and 1 silver coin for a rock which is correct in colour only.

Input:
The first line contains the secret sequence of Tyrion
The next line contains an integer t, no. of times bronn choses to play.
The next t lines each contain a sequence.

Output:
For each t lines you have to print the number of golds followed by number of silvers.
