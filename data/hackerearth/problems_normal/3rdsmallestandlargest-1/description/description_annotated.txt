Alice decides to challenge Bob to a problem. She gives him a number. 

Bob can rearrange the digits of this number by applying pair-wise swaps between any †2‡ digits in the number as many times as he wants. Now Alice asks him to write down all the distinct numbers that he can form and sort them. Of these she wants him to tell her the 3^rd Smallest and the †3‡^rd Largest possible number(numerically). 

Now the number itself might be quite large having up to 10^5 digits and it is also known that the number will have only †1-9‡ as digits(Alice does not like †0‡ for some reason).
Help Bob with this task!

Input:
First line contains  †T‡  which is the number of test cases.
T lines follow each containing an integer  †N ‡ .

Output:
For each input †N‡, output one line containing the †3‡^rd Smallest Number and the †3‡^rd Largest number separated by a space. If it doesn't exist, instead print "Not possible!"(without the quotes)

Constraints:

†1 ≤ T ≤ 10‡
†1 ≤ No \, of \, digits \, in \, N  ≤ 10^5‡

Scoring:

†1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ No \, of \, digits \, in \, N ≤ 10 ‡ (20 pts)
†1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 10 ≤ No \, of \, digits \, in \, N  ≤ 10^3‡ (30 pts)
†1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1000 ≤ No \, of \, digits \, in \, N ≤ 10^5‡ (50 pts)

SAMPLE OUTPUT

Not possible!
1322 3122

Explanation

 Case 1:  We can make these numbers from †123‡ †{123,132,213,231,312,321}‡. Of these the †3rd‡ from the front is †213‡ and from back is †231‡.

 Case 2: We can only make †4‡ from this. Hence it is not possible!

 Case 3: We can make †12‡ distinct numbers from this number. The smallest †3‡ are † 1223, 1232, 1322‡. The largest †3‡ are † 3221,3212,3122. ‡
