Description
†IIT Gandhinagar‡ has a strong policy against plagiarism. The institute decides to develop a program that measures how different two texts are from each other. Suppose there are two text strings A and B, the program should be able to calculate the minimum number of characters that must be added to and/or removed from A to get B, called †Dissimilarity‡ (or equivalently, the total
numbers of characters that must be added to A and B to make them equal).

Input Format
First line contains A
Second line contains B

Output Format
One line containing the Dissimilarity of A to B

Input Limits
0 < Length(A), Length(B) < 200

SAMPLE INPUT
written word
kitten purred

SAMPLE OUTPUT
9

Explanation

For example if A is "written word" and B is "kitten purred" we can delete 4 characters from A to get "itten rd" and then add 5 new ones(k,p,u,r,e) to get B, such that the total number of characters added or removed from A to get B count to 9. Therefore we define the Dissimilarity of A from B to be 9.

You are required to write the program to compute the dissimilarity of two texts.
