  Geeko is very happy because his exam are over so he is busy in playing
  games and watching movies, today he has watched lord of the rings 
He got so fascinated after watching the movie that he is seeing himself
  in the movie in his dreams. Suddenly Gollum arrives in his dream  and 
  Ask a riddle to Geeko. 

 Gollum ask him about a weirdness of  complete k-ary tree.
 A complete k-ary tree is tree which start with a root node and at each level every node
   is completely filled(ie having k branches ) except at last level. Gollum ask him to find out 
   the weirdness of the complete k-ary tree at nth level. 
Note:- level is same as the levels in the classical definition of tree 
Weirdness of the complete k-ary tree can be calculated as follows
Geeko has to divide  number of nodes of complete k-ary tree by 10 and at each step 
add modulo (number of nodes%10) to the weirdness of complete k-ary tree until the number of nodes becomes 0. According to the rule he has to first perform modulo operation than division. 

 Geeko got stuck in the  problem so he ask you programmers to give him the weirdness of the
 complete k-ary tree

 Note root of complete k-ary is at level 0
 INPUT 
 The first line of each test file contains a integer t denoting the number of
  test case.Each test case contains two numbers k and n  representing the the 
  number of branches and level of complete k-ary tree respectively
 OUTPUT 
 for each test case output single number the Weirdness of the complete k-ary tree in new line.
  
 CONSTRAINTS 
 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 

 2 ≤ k ≤10 

 0 ≤ n ≤10000

SAMPLE INPUT
2
2 3
3 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
6
4

Explanation

For sample case 1
no of nodes =15
step 1: mod=15%10->5 no of nodes=15/10->1
step 2: mod=1%10->1 no of nodes=1/10->0
since no of nodes are now 0 hence stop here
ans=5+1=6
