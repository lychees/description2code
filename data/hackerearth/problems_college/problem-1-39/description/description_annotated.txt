Note:If more than one answer is possible , print the smallest one.

Input Format: 

The first line contains T, the number of testcases. 
T lines follow, each line contains 3 space separated integers a, b and c respectively.

Output Format: 

For each test case , print the multiple of c which is closest to a^b

Constraints:
