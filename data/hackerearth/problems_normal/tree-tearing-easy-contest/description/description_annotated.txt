You are given a tree consising of †N‡ vertices. What is the minimum number of vertices that should be removed that all the remaining parts of the initial tree will contain less than †K‡ vertices?

Input
The first line contains one integer †K‡.
The second line contains one integer †N‡.
The third line contains †N-1‡ space-separated intgers †ai‡ for †2 ≤ i ≤ N‡ which means that vertices †i‡ and †ai‡ are connected by an edge. 

Output
Output one number - answer for the question.

Constraints
†1 ≤ K, N ≤ 10 000‡
†ai < i‡

SAMPLE INPUT

1 1 2 2 3 2 3 6 6 6 7

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3

Explanation

We can remove vertices †2, 3, 6‡.
