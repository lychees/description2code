Benny noticed a random property of numbers. The numbers which followed this property were called as interesting numbers by Benny. Let's dive into what Benny discovered about these numbers.

†1‡ is an interesting number.

For every †N‡ > †1‡ , †N‡ is interesting if it has odd number of interesting proper divisors.
For example, †2‡ and †3‡ are interesting numbers, but †4‡ is not interesting.

You are given †T‡ integers. For each given integer, you have to determine whether it is interesting or not.  

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer †T‡ denoting the given integers.
The next †T‡ lines contain a single integer †X‡

Output

For each number in a single line, print "Yes" if the number is interesting and "No" otherwise (without quotes).

Constraints
†1‡ ≤ †T‡ ≤ †5000‡
†1‡ ≤ †X‡ ≤ †10^{11}‡

†Note‡
†25‡% of the test files have †X‡ ≤ †10^{6}‡.

Explanation

In the given sample case, all numbers from †1‡ to †5‡, except †4‡, are interesting. The number '†4‡' has two proper divisors and both of them are interesting. Hence, it has even number of interesting proper divisors.
