Description
You are given two strings S and T, such that length of S is greater than the length of T.
Then a substring of S is defined as a sequence of characters which appear consecutively in S.

Find the total number of †distinct‡ substrings of M such that T is a substring of M

Input Format
One line containing strings S and T separated by a space.

Output Format
One line containing the number of distinct substrings of M such that T is a substring of M

Input Limits:
0 < Length(S), Length(T) < 100

SAMPLE INPUT
abcc c

SAMPLE OUTPUT
6

Explanation

Suppose  the  string  S  is  abcc.  Then  the  †distinct‡  substrings  of  S  are
a, b, c, ab, bc, cc, abc, bcc, abcc
