Given two binary strings †A‡ and †B‡, count how many cyclic permutations of †B‡ when taken XOR with †A‡ give 0.

Input 
First line contains †T‡, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of two lines, first line contains †A‡ and next line contains †B‡.   

Output 
For each testcase, print required answer in one line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
1 ≤ length(A) = length(B) ≤ 10^5

SAMPLE INPUT

Explanation

Testcase 1:
Three cyclic permutations of string B are 101, 110, 011.
Only one of them gives 0 when taken XOR with A.

Testcase 2:
Three cyclic permutations of string B are 111, 111, 111.
All of them gives 0 when taken XOR with A.
