2.  It is not directly in front of a bus stop.
3.  It is not 5 meters before a bus stop.
4.  It is not 10 meters before a bus stop.
5.  It is not directly in front of a side-street.
6.  It is not 5 meters before a side-street.
7.  It is not 5 meters after a side-street.
The street will be represented as a string, where each character describes a section of the street 5 meters in length. So the first character describes the first 5 meters of the street, the second character describes the next 5 meters and so on. street will use 'D' for driveway, 'B' for bus stop, 'S' for side-street and '-' for all other sections of the street. A position is directly in front of an object if it has the same index as the object in street. A position is before an object if its index is lower than the index of the object in street. Finally, a position is after an object if its index is higher than the index of the object in street.
