This problem of Oz is very straight forward. You are given †N distinct‡ prime integers i.e †p1, p2,..., pN‡ and an interval †[L,R]‡. Calculate number of integers in this interval that are divisible by †at least one‡ of the given primes.

Input 
First line of input contain an integer †T‡ — the number of test cases. †T‡ tests follow. First line of each test case contain 3 integers — †N, L, R‡. and the next line contains †N‡ distinct prime integers - †p1, p2,..., pN‡.

Output
For each test case output a single number — number of integers in †[L,R]‡, that are divisible by †at least one‡ of the given primes.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10
1 < pi < 1000 where i=1,2..N 
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^18

Explanation

For second sample : 
Numbers in the interval [1,10] which are divisible by at least one prime from (2,3) are as follow :
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10
