There are †N‡ marbles in a line, numbered 1 through †N‡ from left to right.  Count numbers of ways to remove exactly †M‡ marbles such that there are exactly †C‡ remaining connected components. A part [a,b] of sequence is called a connected component if for all a ≤ i ≤ b there is a marble at position i and also there are no marbles at positions a-1 and b+1 (either because those marbles have been removed or because they are out of range [1,N]).

Input

The first line contains †T‡ - the number of test cases. Then †T‡ test cases follow.

Each test consists of 1 line containing 3 positive integers †N‡, †M‡ and †C‡. 

Output

For each test, print the number of ways of removing marbles satisfying our condition. Since this number can be very large, you must print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
