The statement of this problem is very simple: you are given a non-negative integer †X‡. Whether it's divisible by †41‡?

Input
The first line contains one integer †T‡ - denoting the number of test cases.
The following †T‡ lines contain 4 integers †a[0], a1, c, n‡ each and describe each test case:

Let's consider decimal representation of the number †X‡ as an array  where †a[0]‡ is the leftmost (highest) digit. You are given †a[0], a1‡ and each †a[i]‡ for †2 ≤ i ≤ n-1‡ can be found by formula:

†a[i] = ( a[i - 1]*c + a[i - 2] ) modulo 10‡

Output
For each test case output †YES‡ if the corresponding integer is divisible by †41‡ and †NO‡ otherwise.

Constraints
†T ≤ 2000‡
†1 ≤N ≤ 50000‡
†0 ≤ a[0], a1, c < 10‡

SAMPLE INPUT
