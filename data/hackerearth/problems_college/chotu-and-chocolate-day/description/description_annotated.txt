On Chocolate day, Chotu wants to give his girlfriend a box of chocolate. Chotu has a †N X N‡ square box and †N^2‡ chocolates each having a †distinct‡ sweetness value between †1‡ and †N^2‡.

To make the box look attractive Chotu must fill each row with chocolates arranged in †increasing‡ value of sweetness. Chotu also knows that his girlfriend loves the number †K‡ so he wants to maximize the total sweetness of the †K^th‡ column.
Help Chotu arrange the chocolate in the box in a way that each row has choclates with increasing value of sweetness and the total sweetness of †K^th‡ column is maximized.

As there are multiple ways to arrange chocolates, your task is to tell Chotu the maximum possible sweetness he can have for the †K^th‡ column.
