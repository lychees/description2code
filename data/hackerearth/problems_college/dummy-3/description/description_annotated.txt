Seeing all other business tycoons from Gotham attending †Vibrant Gujarat 2015‡, Bruce Wayne felt left out and decided he too would attend the summit. He asked Alfred to arrange passes for him but was too late. The passes were all sold out. He later found out that a man named Falcone was selling passes on the black market. 

Wayne went to Falcone to get those passes but Falcone refused. It wasn't money that Falcone desired, he just wanted to have a little bit of fun. In order to earn those passes, Bruce Wayne would have to solve a given number of, say N, sudoku puzzles and tell Falcone the sum of the numbers on the main diagonals of all the puzzles in order to get those passes. 

Help Bruce solve this question so that he can get those passes from Falcone to attend this summit.
