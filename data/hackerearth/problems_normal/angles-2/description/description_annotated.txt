Raju and Rani and playing games in the school. Raju has recently learned how to draw angles. 
He knows how to draw some angles. He also can add/subtract any of the two angles he draws. Rani now wants to test Raju.    

†Input:‡
First line contains ††N‡† and ‡†K‡†, denoting number of angles Raju knows how to draw and ‡†K‡† the number of angles Rani will tell Raju to draw. 
Next line contains, ‡†N‡† space separated integers denoting the angles which Raju knows how to draw.    Next line contains ‡†K‡† space separated numbers denoting the angles Rani wants Raju to draw.   

‡Output:†
For each of the ‡†K‡† angles Rani wants Raju to draw, output "‡YES†" or "‡NO†" (quotes for clarity) if he can draw those angles or not respectively.      

‡Constraints: 
†1 ≤ N,K ≤ 10‡ 
†0 ≤ All\; angles ≤ 360‡†

SAMPLE INPUT
1 2
100
60 70

SAMPLE OUTPUT
YES
NO

Explanation

Adding ‡100† fifteen times gives ‡1500† degrees, which is same as ‡60†.
‡70† cannot be drawn any way.
