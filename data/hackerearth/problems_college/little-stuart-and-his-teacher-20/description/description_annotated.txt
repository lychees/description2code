Little Stuart is a smart guy, and he loves mathematics. Today his math teacher taught his class about common factors.  After finishing the class his teacher asked them a question: For a given number † "N"‡ calculate the number of unordered pairs (A,B) which have at least one common factor where † 1 ≤ A < B ≤ N ‡.

†Note‡: 1 is not considered as common factor.

Input
First line contain the number of test cases† "T"‡
Next † "T"‡ lines  contain a number † "N"‡

†Input Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100000

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 1000000

†Output:‡
For each case print total number of pairs.

SAMPLE INPUT

Explanation

For testcase - 3 ,   

N = 5  

Some possible pairs = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5)]   

The only pair which has common factor is (2, 4). So the answer is 1 for N = 5.   

Note: 1 is not considered as common factor.
