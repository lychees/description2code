After figuring out what was that something that was bothering him, something more started bothering Micro. See, Micro's a kind of guy, who always has something bothering him. This time his friend Chacha will help him find out if he passes the "Test". Chacha gave him an array A having N integers. Now Chacha will ask Q queries. Each query will be of one of the following types:

Assume 1-based indexing of the array.Help Micro perform the queries.

Input:
First line of input consists of two space separated integers denoting N and Q.
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Following Q lines consists of query as described in the statement.

Output:
For each query of type 1 print the answer in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, Q, x ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ A[i], val ≤ 10^9
