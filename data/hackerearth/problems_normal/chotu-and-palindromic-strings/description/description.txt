Everyone knows that chotu likes palindromic strings. One day, he found 2 ordinary strings s1 and s2. Now he wonders if he could make a palindrome by concatenating s1 and s2 in any order. i.e if s1s2 or s2s1 is a palindrome.

Each test case contains two lines, first line contains string s1 and second line contains string s2.

Print T lines, either "YES" or "NO"(without quotes).

Constrains
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ |s1|, |s2| ≤ 10000
Both strings contain only lower case letters.
