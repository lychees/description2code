Chintu wants to take her girlfriend in a restaurant for dinner but getting entry in that restaurant is not that easy. Restaurant gives each of its visitor a String †S‡ and two integers †i,j‡ and allows them to enter in the restaurant only if the letter at index i is equal to the letter at index j. 
Since Chintu is there regular customer so instead of giving him a pair of integers they(restaurant's manager) gives him †N‡ pair of integers. You need to find whether Chintu will get the entry or not.

Input format:
First line of the input contains a string †S‡. Next line contains an integer †N‡, the number of pair of integers given to Chintu. These pairs are given in order. Next N line contains 2 integers †i‡ and †j‡.(1-based indexing) 

Output format:
Print "Yes" if Chintu is able to get entry else print "No".

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|
