You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal. 
Input
First line contains T (number of test cases). 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
Next line contains a non-negative integer a.
Next line contains a non-negative integer b.
The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.
Output
Print the symbol < if a < b and the symbol > if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol =.
