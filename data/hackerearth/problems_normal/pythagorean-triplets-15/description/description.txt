Pythagorean triplet (a,b,c) satisfies: 
You will be given an integer N. You have to count how many triplets a,b,c exist such that  
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ N.

Input: 
First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of only one integer in one line.    

Output: 
For each testcase, print the required answer.   

Constraints: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 100 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

SAMPLE INPUT

Explanation

In first testcase, only one triplet ie. (3,4,5)
In second testcase, two triplets ie. (3,4,5),(6,8,10).
