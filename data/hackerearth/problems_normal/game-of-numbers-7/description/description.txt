Game of numbers is a game where you are given two integers (X and Y), and you have to print the number of special numbers between X and Y both inclusive.  
The property of a special numbers is as follows:  
A special number is not divisible by any number of the form ZZ* where (Z\; >\; 1).    

Input: 
T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting X and Y.    

Output:
The required answer in one line for each test case.    

Constraints:  
1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10 ^ 9 
0 ≤ |X-Y| ≤ 10^6

SAMPLE INPUT
