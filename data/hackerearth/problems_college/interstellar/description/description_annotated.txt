“Play to WIN !”

For the annual sports trophy in FrCRCE, the class with the †highest mean points‡ over †N‡ sport events is awarded the trophy. You are too excited to know whether your class has won it or not, so you ask Steve the sports secretary of the college to give you the score sheet for the year. But since Steve is a very sincere person he doesn’t disclose all the scores, however he does tell you the †highest mean score among the other classes called the threshold score (P)‡.

You are given the number of sports event for this year †(N)‡, the points your class has obtained in each event †(ai)‡  and the threshold score †(P)‡. You need to determine whether your class has won the sports trophy or not.

In case of a †Tie‡ Steve favours you since you are his best friend.
