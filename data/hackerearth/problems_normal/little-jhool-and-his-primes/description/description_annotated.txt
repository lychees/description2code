Little Jhool solves huge mathematical questions, for which people usually use super-computers, and everything - but hey, this is Little Jhool we are talking about. This time it's not Little Jhool who is going to solve a tough problem, instead he has asked you to solve this problem for you.

He gives you four things to deal with this problem.
 1. An infinite Arithmetic progression.
 2. A prime number.  - †p.‡
 3. The starting number of an Arithmetic Progression. - †a.‡
 4. Common difference in the arithmetic progression given to him. - †d.‡ 

And he asks you to do a very simple thing. With the three powerful numbers, you have at your disposal, you have to †print the first index of a number in that  Arithmetic Progression, which is a multiple of the given prime number, p.‡

†Input format:‡
The first line contains a number, †tc,‡ denoting the number of test cases. The second line contains two integers, †a‡ and †d‡ - a depicts the first term in the AP, d depicts the common difference. The last line contains the prime number.

†Output format:‡
You have to print the †FIRST‡ index †(0-based)‡ of the multiple of the given prime number in the given AP. If no such element exists in this infinite AP, then print †-1‡.

†Constraints:‡
†0 ≤ a, d, ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ p ≤ 10^9‡

Explanation

In the first test case, the AP would be: 4, 4+9=13, 13+9=22, 22+9=31 - and the prime number is 11, so the index is [2].

In the second case, the AP would be: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35 - the prime number is 7, so the index is [5].
