Tom is very weak at maths, his teacher gave him a simple problem of dividing two numbers but as usual Tom is having difficulty solving the problem. Can you help tom solve the problem ?

Teacher has given him 3 numbers †a‡, †b‡ and †c‡. The task is to divide †a‡ by †b‡ and write the answer upto †c‡ decimal places.

†Input:‡

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each line of test case contains 3 numbers †a‡, †b‡ and †c‡ as described in the question.

†Output:‡

For each test case, output the required division of †a/b‡ upto †c‡ decimal places.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100,

1 ≤ †a,b‡ ≤ 100000

0 ≤ †c‡ ≤ 100000
