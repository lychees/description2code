Second line of input contains an integer M. then, next line contains M integers as height of Candles N, separated by spaces.

OUTPUT

Print the maximum number of days he can be away from darkness.

Constraints:

0 ≤ N ≤ 25000

1 ≤ t ≤ 1000000

SAMPLE INPUT
1

2 2 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3

Explanation

First Line is the no of test cases
2nd line is the no of candles
Next line gives heights of candles
