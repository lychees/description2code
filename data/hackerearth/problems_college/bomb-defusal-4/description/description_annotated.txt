Exams are over !! Everyone is now in the mood to play the multiplayer game Counter-Strike 1.6. 12 players decide to play Counter-Strike 1.6, each one playing from his own room via LAN on his own laptop. The 12 
players (6 on 6) : †Counter Terrorists vs Terrorists‡ are playing on the map de_dust 2 . 

They decide to play a total of †T‡ rounds. In every round, Terrorists plant a bomb at the point †(u,v)‡ of the 2-D coordinate plane. HELL, a Counter-Terrorist, is a very good player and manages to remain the sole survivor at the end of every round. 

However just surviving won't help the Counter-Terrorists win that round. HELL has to defuse the bomb the terrorists planted (while they were alive) before it blows up. †The bomb will blow up exactly P seconds from the current moment (ie. from the moment HELL remains the sole survivor).‡ 

HELL is currently at a point †(x,y)‡ of the coordinate plane. HELL can move from a general point †(a,b) to either of the 4 points (a+i,b+i) , (a+i,b-i) , (a-i,b+i) or (a-i,b-i)  in 1 second , i>0 is an integer and i is always of HELL's choice in every move he makes‡ . HELL has to reach the bomb site within a time †strictly lesser than P seconds‡ in order to defuse the bomb safely, and, he reaches the bomb (if he can) †optimally‡. Once a round ends, all players become alive for the next round.

Given the entire situation of every round (ie. from the moment HELL is the sole survivor) you have to find out the result of each and every round. Assume that HELL is carrying the defusal kit and hence defusing the bomb takes negligible amount of time.

Input

The first line consists of †T‡ the number of rounds the 10 of them play. The next †T‡ lines are such that each line consists of 5 space-separated integers †P, x, y, u, v.‡

Output

Print the result of every round on a new line. If HELL can reach the bomb site on time print "†Counter-Terrorists Win !‡" otherwise print "†Terrorists Win !‡" (Quotes for clarity).

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 1000

1 ≤ †P‡ ≤ 10

-10000 ≤ †x,y,u,v‡ ≤ +10000

Explanation

Lets take the first 2 rounds. 
In both the rounds HELL has to go from (1,2) -> (3,4). When he is at (1,2), he will choose i=2 and go to point (3,4) in the following manner : 
(1,2) -> (1+2,2+2) = (3,4). 
The minimum time HELL takes to reach the bombsite is 1 second. In the first round 1 second < 2 seconds hence the bomb has been successfully  defused. This does not happen in the second round.

In each of the next 3 rounds HELL plays optimally in the following manner :
(1,2) -> (1+2,2+2) = (3,4) (HELL chooses i=2)
(3,4) -> (3+1,4-1) = (4,3) (HELL chooses i=1)

In the last round, HELL is already present at the bombsite. Hence the time taken by him to reach the bombsite = 0 .
