Given an amount A, we want you to compute the number of ways in which you
can gather A rupees if you have an infinite supply of each of C =  {1, 3, 5} valued rupee coins.

Input:

First line contains T, the number of test-cases. This is followed by T lines, where each line consists of the amount A.

Output:

For each test case, print the number of ways in which A can be formed using an infinite supply of 1, 3 and 5 rupee coins.

Constraints

T < 100
A < 101

Explanation :

A = 5

Ways this amount can be achieved: {1,1,1,1,1}, {1,1,3}, {5}
Hence, the answer is 3.
