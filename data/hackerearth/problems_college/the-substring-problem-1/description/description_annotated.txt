You have been given a set of †N‡ strings †S1, S2, .... SN‡. Consider any non-empty string †S‡ (†S‡ need not belong to the given set of †N‡ strings). Suppose †S‡ occurs (as a †substring‡) in †K‡ out of the †N‡ given strings in the set. Your job is to choose †S‡ such that the value of †K is maximized‡. If there are many such strings, choose the one with the †least length‡. If there are many such strings with the least length, choose the lexicographically †smallest‡ of them all.

†Input:‡

The first line consists of †T‡ the number of test cases.
The first line in each test case consists of †N‡, the number of words in the given set. Each of the next †N‡ lines contains a single word consisting of †lowercase English alphabets‡ †(a-z)‡ only.

†Output:‡

Print the answer to each test case on a new line, the answer to each test case being a single string †S‡ as described in the problem above.

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 5

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 100

1 ≤ |†Si‡| ≤ 100, |†Si‡| denotes the length of the input words.
