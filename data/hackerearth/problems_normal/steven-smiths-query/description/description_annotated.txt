Steven Smith, being a phenomenal Test and ODI Batsmen got bored because of too much of T20's going on.  
So he prepares a list of TEST runs and ODI runs of †N‡ Batsmen.
 The list contains two integers for each Batsmen, †Ti‡ and †Oi‡ denoting Test runs and ODI runs of
ith Batsmen (†1 ≤ i ≤ N‡). 
Now, for each Batsmen, Smith decides to find - that particular batsmen is †BETTER‡  than how many other Batsmen?
†BETTER‡ is defined as :
†1)‡ If test runs of ith Batsmen is more than test runs of jth Batsmen && odi runs of ith  is more than that of jth Batsmen,
 then ith Batsmen is †BETTER‡ than jth Batsmen.
       †or‡†2)‡ If test runs of ith Batsmen is equal to that of jth Batsmen  && odi runs of ithBatsmen is more than that of jth Batsmen, then ith Batsmen is †BETTER‡.
       †or‡†3)‡ If odi runs of ith Batsmen is equal to that of jth Batsmen && test runs of ith Batsmen is more than that of jth Batsmen, then ith Batsmen is †BETTER‡.

As number of Batsmen can be really large, Steven Smith decides to write a program for solving the problem. But as he has to go for the preparation of the next World-cup match,
he asks you to solve the problem for him?
Input : First line contains a integer †N‡, number of Batsmen.
Next following †N‡ lines contains two integers separated by space, †Ti‡ and †Oi‡ denoting Test runs and ODI runs of
ith Batsmen (†1 ≤ i ≤ N‡). 

Output : Print †N‡ lines containing one integer per line, denoting ithbatsmen is BETTER than how many other Batsmen. (1 ≤ i ≤ N)

Explanation

1st Batsmen is not BETTER than any other Batsmen ,ie, 0

2nd Batsmen is also not BETTER than any other Batsmen ,ie, 0

3rd  Batsmen is BETTER than all other Batsmen ,ie, 3

4th Batsmen is BETTER than the 1st Batsmen ,ie, 1
