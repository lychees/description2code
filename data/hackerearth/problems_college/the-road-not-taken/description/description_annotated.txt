Robert Frost is standing on a cross-way with six roads diverging out. He decides to choose the road not taken. After travelling the pathway he reaches a similar but yet another cross-way with six another roads diverging out. He keeps on travelling like this from one cross-way to another and keeps discovering that each cross-way diverges out into six roads including the one from where he came last. After travelling exactly n roads he finds himself on the same cross-way he had started. Assume that the cross-ways are arranged in a grid interconnecting themselves by six roads. You have to tell Robert the number of distinct paths he can follow by travelling exactly n roads and returning to the cross-way from where he had started.

Refer the image for arrangement of cross-ways.

Input:

Input will consist of t test cases followed by exactly t lines consisting of number of roads travelled i.e. n.

Output:

For every test case t you have to print the number of distinct paths.

Constraints:

0 < t < 1000
