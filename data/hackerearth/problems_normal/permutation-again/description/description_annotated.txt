Given an integer †N‡.  Find out the †PermutationSum‡ where †PermutationSum‡ for integer †N‡ is defined as the maximum sum of difference of adjacent elements in all arrangement of numbers from †1‡ to †N‡. 

†NOTE‡: Difference between two elements †A‡ and †B‡ will be considered as abs(A-B) or |A-B| which always be a positive number.

†Input:‡
First line of input contains number of test case †T‡. Each test case contains a single integer †N‡.  

†Output:‡
For each test case print the maximum value of †PermutationSum‡.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10000
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^5

Explanation

Test Case #3:
For N=3, possible arrangements are :
{1,2,3}
{1,3,2}
{2,1,3}
{2,3,1}
{3,1,2}
{3,2,1}   
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {1,2,3} is 2 i.e abs(1-2)+abs(2-3)=2
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {1,3,2} is 3.
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {2,1,3} is 3.
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {2,3,1} is 3.
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {3,1,2} is 3.
Value of PermutationSum for arrangement {3,2,1} is 2.
So the maximum value of PermutationSum for all arrangements is 3.
