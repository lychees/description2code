The Enigma crew came to know some of the location where the bombs are planted. So they started to find the code through which they can diffuse the bombs .Each bomb has different code for diffusion. The crew found the solution the diffusion code is between the ranges 1 to N-1 where N is the integer value. The summation of the multiple of 3 or 5 within the range give the diffusion code.
