The statement of this problem is short and simple. There is a tree with vertices labelled from †1‡ to †N‡. You are supposed to count the total number of such pairs in a tree that satisfy the given properties :

A pair †(A,B)‡ should be counted when

†A‡ is the ancestor of node †B‡.

The product of values of the node †A‡ and †B‡ is not greater than a fixed value †K‡.

The value of the node is same as its label.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers †N‡ and †K‡. This is followed by †N-1‡ lines, each containing two 

integers †S‡ and †D‡ where node S is the parent of node D.

†Output:‡

Print the total number of pairs in the tree.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤10^5

1 ≤ †K‡ ≤10^10

1 ≤ †S,D‡ ≤N

SAMPLE INPUT
4 3
1 2
1 3
1 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

The required pairs are (1,2) and (1,3).
