Given an integer †N‡,Find  how many strings of length †N‡ are possible, consisting only of characters †{ 'A','B' and 'C' }‡  with each character †{'A','B' and 'C'}‡ occurs at least once.  

†Input:‡
First line of each test case contains number of test cases †T‡. Each test case contains a single integer †N‡.  

†Output:‡
For each test case print the expected output. Output may be too large so print it modulo †10^9+7‡.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^9
