Given an array A(A0, A1…. An-1) of n integers. Your task is to find the smallest number larger than a given no. X in the range [l,r] inclusive. Indexing is 0 based. If there is no greater no. than X in the specified range output -1.

For example: A=[1 2 3 8 15 6 7 1 8 7], l=1 and r=5

For X=1 answer should be 2
For X=2, answer should be 3
For X=5, answer should be 6
For X=20, answer should be -1.

Input

First line contains for integers n, l, r and Q, Q denotes no. of queries. Next line contains n integers denoting array A. In the next line, Q space separated integers are given each integer represents the value X for a query.

Output

Print the just largest no. for each query.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ X ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000
0 ≤ l, r<n
