Maxi and Dumpy are playing with numbers. Maxi throws a ball up in the air and shouts a random number. Dumpy notes down this number on a piece of paper. They repeat this †N‡ times.
But Dumpy just found out that there are many repetitive numbers in the list. He doesn't like it. He asks you to filter the list, remove the repetition and keep only the first occurrence of each number.

†Input:‡
First line contains an integer †N‡, Next line contains †N‡ space separated integers where †Ai‡ is the integer that Maxi shouts in the †i‡'th round.  

†Output:‡
Print the final space-separated list of numbers.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^5 
0 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 10^6
