After Learning Prime Numbers, †Dark‡ want to revise the rules of †composite‡ numbers.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself.

Read more about it:  Composite Number .

He wants to generate all composite numbers between two given numbers but as you all are aware with Dark's Lucky number, †7‡ he wants to know only the composite numbers which have †digit 7‡ in it.

Input

The first line contains †T‡, the number of test cases.

Followed by †T‡ lines each contain two numbers †M‡ and †N‡

Output

For every test case print the †total count‡ of composite numbers which contain †7‡ as a digit.

If no composite number with digit 7 between †M‡ and †N‡
then print -1.

Separate the answers for each test case by an †empty line‡.

Constraints

   1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
   1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 1000000

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 9
14 37
1 6

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-1
1
-1

Explanation

Test Case 1:
Composite numbers between 1 to 9 are 4,6,8,9 and their is no number having digit 7.so output -1
Test Case 2:
Similarly for 14 to 37 we have 14,15,16,... but only 27  with digit 7 and a composite number. so output 1
Test Case 3:
No composite number with digit 7
so output -1.
