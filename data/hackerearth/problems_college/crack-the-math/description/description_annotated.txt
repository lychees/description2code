Given two binary numbers A,B i.e., numbers containing only zero or one.  Let the i th bit of A and i th bit of B differ by d. We need to form a binary number C such that the i th bit of C = 1 if 2^d is even, else it should be 0.

Input :
First line contains the number of test cases T
For each test case, 2 lines containing A and B respectively

Constraints :
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
Both A, B are of same length.
Don't ignore leading zeros.
A, B have at most 100 bits
