Oz plays popular †MMORPG Dota2‡. Invoker is one of the favourite Oz's heroes. Oz's skills are not perfect yet, so he uses only two spells - †SunStrike‡ and †Tornado‡. Each of these spells takes some mana points to cast and may be used several times. Oz uses the spells to kill neutral creeps in the map. The creeps are placed at line †OX‡, you may assume that each creep is a single point on the line. 
When Oz uses SunStrike, he kills †all‡ creeps placed †on single point‡. When Tornado is used then it kills all creeps †on a line segment‡ (including creeps placed on the ends of the segment). Oz may cast spells in arbitrary order and may use them at any place of the line, however the length of Tornado segment is †fixed‡. Help Oz to Find, what is the †minimum amount of mana points‡ he should spend to kill all the creeps. 

Input
The first line contains three integers †Ms,Mt and Lt‡ - Number of mana points a single SunStrike takes, Number of mana points a single Tornado takes and length of Tornado segment. The second line contains a single integer †N‡ - amount of creeps in the line. The next line contains †N‡ non-negative integers †x1,x2,...,xN‡ - coordinates of creeps on the line.

Output
Output a single number - †minimal amount of mana points‡ necessary to kill all the creeps.

Constraints
1 ≤ †Ms, Mt, Lt‡ ≤ 100 
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 100 
0 ≤ †x1,x2,...,xN‡ ≤ 1000
