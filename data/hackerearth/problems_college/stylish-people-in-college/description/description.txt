Sakshi was contesting to be the most stylist person in his college. He had to collect maximum points from the judges to be able to win. However there was a problem. The judges were sitting in a line and each pair of adjacent judges had ego issues with each other. So if one judge gave X points to Rahul then the next judge won’t give him any points. Rahul had a friend in the organizing team and through him he had found out the exact points he would get from each judge if he chose their score to be considered. Help him find out the maximum points he can score.
