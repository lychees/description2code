Saksham is fond of perfection in everything. He is also fond of playing FIFA so he likes to have perfection in his shots while shooting for a goal. Consider there is a goalpost, it has two corners left corner and right corner. There is a line in the center of the goalpost. If the player is on the left of the line it is better to shoot toward right corner while if he is on the right of the line it is advisable( by Saksham) to shoot towards the left corner.

Now the player is running towards the goalpost. His position(left or right) is indicated by an integer. If the integer is negative, the player is considered to be on the left of the line. If it is positive , he is considered to be on the right of the line. While if it is zero, the player is at the center line so he can shoot on either of the corners.

Given the positions of the player at different times before shooting, you have to tell the better direction to shoot at the maximum given time according to Saksham's Theory.

†INPUT:‡

First line of Input contains one integer †n‡ i.e. number of positions that will be input. Next †n‡ lines contain two integers each, one the time of the position †t‡ and another a integer †p‡ denoting the position.

†OUTPUT‡:

Output a single line containing one of the three strings(without quotes):

†"Left Corner"‡ 

If the player is on the right of the center line.

†"Right Corner"‡

If the player is on the left of the center line.

†"Either Corner"‡

If the player is at the center line.

†CONSTRAINTS‡:

1 ≤†n‡ ≤ 10^6

0 ≤†t‡ ≤ 10^8

-10^6 ≤†p‡ ≤ 10^6

SAMPLE INPUT
2
5 3
10 -3
8 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Right Corner

Explanation

In the sample input the maximum time is 10 and the corresponding position of the player is -3 i.e. on the left of the center line.
Therefore, the output should be:

Right Corner
