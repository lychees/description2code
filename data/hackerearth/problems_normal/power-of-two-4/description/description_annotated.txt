Given an array †A‡. Is there any subset of array A in which if we do †AND‡ of all elements of that subset then output should be in power of two (for example : 1,2,4,8,16 and so on ).    

†Input:‡ 
First line contains number of test cases †T‡. Each test first line contains †N‡ size of array †A‡ and next line contains †N‡ space separated integers.  

†Output:‡ 
For each test case print †YES‡ if there is any subset of array †A‡ in which if we do †AND‡ of all elements of that subset then output should be in power of two else print †NO‡.  

†Constraints:‡ 
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 1000 
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 200 
0 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 10^9
