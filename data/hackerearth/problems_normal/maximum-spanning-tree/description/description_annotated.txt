You are given a weighted graph with †N‡ vertices and †M‡ edges. Find the total weight of its †maximum‡ spanning tree.

Input

The first line contains one integer †T‡ denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case starts with a line containing †2‡ space-separated integer: †N‡ and †M‡. Each of the following †M‡ lines contain description of one edge: three different space-separated integers: †a‡,  †b‡ and †c‡. †a‡ and †b‡ are different and from 1 to N each and denote numbers of vertices that are connected by this edge. †c‡ denotes weight of this edge.

Output

For each test case output one integer - the total weight of its †maximum‡ spanning tree.

Constraints
†1‡ ≤ †T‡ ≤ †20‡
†1‡ ≤ †N‡ ≤ †5000‡
†1‡ ≤ †M‡ ≤ †100 000‡
†1‡ ≤ †c‡ ≤ †10 000‡
