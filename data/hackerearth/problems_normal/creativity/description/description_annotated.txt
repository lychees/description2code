Ed, Edd and Eddy are given an art homework. They have to prepare a banner and print a  single line of  text on it. They can print any text they want. Ed has decided the text that he wants to put on his banner. Lets call it string s1. But he is too lazy to make a new banner all by himself. He borrows an old banner from a friend. But  this banner has some different text already printed on it. Lets call it string s2.  Ed's 'brilliant' mind came up with an idea. He got a pair of scissors and wants to cut the banner at atmost two places so that only the text that  he wants to display is left on a single continuous piece of the banner.

For example, if the string already printed on the banner (i.e. S2) is “i like cartoons” and the string that he wants to take (i.e. S2) is “like”, then he can simply cut the banner before and after “like” and obtain s1.

Another example, if s1 is “hello there” and s2 is “hello hi there”, there is no way Ed can obtain s1. 

Your job is to tell Ed if it is possible to make his banner from the borrowed banner.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer t- the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains s1, the string that Ed wants to display on his banner. The second line of each test case contains s2, the string that is already there on the banner that he borrowed from his friend. 

Output:

For each test case, output 'possible' if it is possible for Ed to make his banner by cutting in atmost two different places. Output 'not possible' if Ed cannot make the banner.
Remember that Ed wants exactly the same text as string s1 on his banner.

Constraints:

1 ≤ t ≤ 10

1 ≤ Length of s1,s2 ≤1000

s1 and s2 will contain only lower-case alphabets and spaces
