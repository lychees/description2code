Now they discovered a special tree of mango and both wanted to have it as it was the most juicy category of mango they have encountered in their life but unfortunately,that special tree gives a single mango in a day so it raised dispute between both Chintu and Pintu as who will eat that and after sometime they came to strategy to resolve this dispute,they decided to play game and the winner will get the golden opportunity to grab that special mango on "pth" day.

Game goes like this,as there were "x" numbers of wooden logs present and each of height "h" surrounding that special tree.Both Chintu and Pintu plays in turn.In each turn one chooses log and cut it into equal parts(greater than 1) and resulting height(necessarily an integer) of each piece being greater than or equal to "d".Now ,each resulting piece also serves as the wooden log in further game.They keep on playing this game until the one who can't make the valid choice looses the game and then the other one will have the hold of that special mango on that day.Chintu will play first.
