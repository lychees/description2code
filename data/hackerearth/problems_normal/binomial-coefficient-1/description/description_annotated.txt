Our hero - †Maga‡ has been working on a research related to Pascal’s Triangle for about a month. He has recently found a new problematic thing for his research. He has to calculate a big number. But he is very busy. Could you do it for him?

You are given a binomial as this: †(a * x + b * y)^n‡. You have to find the binomial coefficient of †x^k * y^(n-k) modulo 10^9+7.‡ 

Input:

You are given 4 integers: each space separated integers †a‡, †b‡, †n‡ and †k‡.

Output:

Output 1 integer: the binomial coefficient of x^k * y^(n-k) †mod‡ (10^9+7).

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †a, b‡ ≤ 100

1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ †k‡ ≤ †min‡(n,10^5)

SAMPLE INPUT
1 1 4 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
6

Explanation

The result is 6. In the (x+y)^4 binomial, the coefficient of x^2 * y^2 is 6.
