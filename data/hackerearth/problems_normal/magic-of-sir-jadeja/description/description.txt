Team India is playing too much cricket in this season. Team players are getting better in their performance with match by match. Sir Jadeja has become a Trump Card for M.S Dhoni. There is a hidden reason of his special position in the team. He can make new copies of a person by some magic. Due to this, players can get many chances to bat. Now there is a fixed batting line up of top 7 batsman decided by Dhoni as : [ "Rohit", "Dhawan", "Kohli", "Yuvraj", "Raina" , "Dhoni", "Sir Jadeja"]. Now they are playing one ball at a time and once they play a ball, Jadeja will make a new copy of that player (including himself) and both the same players will get back in this batting line up. In this way they will get a chance to play a ball turn by turn. Your task is very simple. You are required to output the name of a player as given in the above list who will play a K^th ball.
