Shekhar and his friend Nilesh are playing some unusual game. Initially there are two stacks of nuts. The first stack contains A nuts and the second contains B nuts. A player's move consists of two steps:

Choose one of the stacks from the two and eat it.

Split the other of the stacks into two new stacks. If a player can't split the other stack into two stacks he loses (if stack contains only 1 nut).

Shekhar starts the game. Tell who wins if both players play optimally.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. 

The next T lines contain 2 space - separated integers  A and B  for the current test case.

Output

For every test case, output a single line having the word "Shekhar"  or  "Nilesh"  (without quotes) depending upon who is the  winner of this test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000
Subtask #0[10 points]: Sample
Subtask #1[16 points]: 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10
Subtask #2[30 points]: 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 100
Subtask #3[44 points]: 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000

SAMPLE INPUT
2
1 1
1 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Nilesh
Shekhar

Explanation

In the first test case Shekhar can't finish even the first move, so Nilesh wins.

In the second test case Shekhar eats the first stack (with 1 nut), then splits the second stack (with 2 nuts) into two stacks, and Nilesh loses.
