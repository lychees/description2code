As we know , Professor Dalton is teaching Compiler Design.
During his first class, he found that the students are very talkative.
so,he decided to divide the class into two sections, A & B
such that †the difference between the strength  of two sections
is minimum.‡ 
Print the strength of two sections in non decreasing 
order. 

Input : First line of the input contains number of test cases †T‡,followed by †T‡ integers †(n) (total sum of their strengths)‡ 

†1≤T≤100000 , 1≤n≤100000‡

Output :For each test cases print strength of both section in non decreasing order
