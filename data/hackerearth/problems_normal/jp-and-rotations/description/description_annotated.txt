Kabra is a very good friend of JP. So JP has assigned him a task. Given an array, two operations can be performed on it. They are
1) †L X‡ : Rotate the array towards left by †X‡.
2) †R X‡ : Rotate the array towards right by †X‡.
Now you will be given 2 arrays containing †N‡ unique elements. The first one is the inital array(†A‡) and the second one is target array(†T‡).
Also you will be given a list of †M‡ operations having ids from †1‡ to †M‡ to be serially performed on it. If after performing any operation the array becomes same as the target array print the †id‡ of the operation. If it is not possible print "†-1‡"(without quotes).

†Input format:‡
First line will contain two space separated integers †N‡ and †M‡.
Second line will contain †N‡ space separated integers †Ai‡ denoting the initial array.
Third line will contain †N‡ space separated integers †Ti‡ denoting the target array.
Next †M‡ lines contain the operations of †type 1 or 2‡.

†Output format:‡
Print a single line containing the required answer.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †N‡ , †M‡ ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ †Ai‡ ,  †Ti‡  ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ †X‡ ≤ 1000
†Note:‡ It is guaranteed that the initial and target arrays are different.
†Note:‡ Target array will always be a rotated version of the initial array

SAMPLE INPUT
4 4
2 1 3 4
3 4 2 1
R 1
L 2
L 1
L 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3

Explanation

The initial array is †2 1 3 4‡. Target array is †3 4 2 1‡.
After the first operation the array becomes †4 2 1 3‡.
After the second operation it becomes †1 3 4 2‡.
After the third operation it becomes †3 4 2 1‡. At this moment the array is equal to the target array hence the answer is †3‡.
