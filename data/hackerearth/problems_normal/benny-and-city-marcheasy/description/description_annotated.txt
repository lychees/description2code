From the beginning Benny was a very harsh pig.

She lives in a huge city. City can be determined as a grid with N lines and M columns. The city contains some houses. Each house has it's own beauty. Beauty of house at point(†i‡, †j‡) is †Ai, j‡.

To make city more beautiful Benny decides to destroy some houses. If Benny has destroyed †COUNT‡ lines and columns of the city in total and sum of beauty of not destroyed houses is †SUM‡ then the beauty of the city is †SUM - COUNT * C‡. Where †C‡ is some integer, called coefficient of destruction.

Benny is going to destroy houses in such way: She chooses some line or column and destroy all houses in this line or column.

You task in to find the maximum beauty of the city that Benny can reach after destroying some houses.

†Input format‡

The first line contains three integers †N‡, †M‡, †C‡.
The following †N‡ lines contain †M‡ integers †Ai, j‡ denoting the beauty of the house at point(†i‡, †j‡).

†Output format‡

Print only one integer - maximal beauty of the city that Benny can reach by destroying some houses.

Constraints
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 20
0 ≤ C ≤ 1000
-10000 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 10000
2 ≤ N + M ≤ 20 holds for test cases worth 20% of the problem's score.

†Sample Explanation‡

You have to destroy only first line and then the result beauty of the city will be 2.
