You have been given an integer array A on size N.
You must report the number of ordered pairs (i,j) such that A[i] & A[j] is zero.
Here '&' denotes the BITWISE AND.
(i,j) and (j,i) are considered different.  

Input
First line contains T-Number of Test cases.
First line of each test contains N. Next line contains N integers - the i'th integer A[i].
Output
Output the number of such pairs for each test case.  

Constraints 
T ≤ 10
N ≤ 100000
A[i] ≤ 1000000
