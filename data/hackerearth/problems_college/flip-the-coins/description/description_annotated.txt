†Ramesh‡ and †Suresh's‡ previous attempt to decide who is smarter of them turned out to be indecisive. There was a tie in that too. Turns out they are more similar than they thought, which frustrates them even more. They are now very desperate to find out which one of them is smarter and so they have asked the Mathematics professor yet again to help them come to a conclusion.

The Mathematics Professor is full of puzzles and problems and he already has one in mind for them. It's a game of flipping the coins. It's actually very simple. But this time they both have to do it on a computer. Don't worry, they know how to code so that won't be a problem. The rules go something like this: 
There are '†n‡' coins kept on the table, numbered from 0 to 'n-1'. Initially, each coin is kept tails up. You have to perform two types of operations :  
Flip all coins numbered between A and B inclusive. This is represented by the command: 0 A B
Answer how many coins numbered between A and B inclusive are heads up. This is represented by the command 1 A B

You task, as usual, is to help the professor. So you are supposed to do the same thing Ramesh and Suresh are doing, just faster. So that by the time they are done with it, you would have told professor the answer.

†Input:‡
The first two lines contain two integers, N and Q.The first line after inputting N and Q has to be of form (1).Each of the next Q lines are of the form (2) as mentioned above. 

†Output:‡
Output 1 line for each of the queries of the form (2) containing the required answer for the corresponding query just after the query.
