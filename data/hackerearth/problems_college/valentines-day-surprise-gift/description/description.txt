Vivek and Sita are in a relationship. Both of them love playing with numbers and treat each other with puzzles every now and then.

When Sita visits her class she comes  to see that there is a gift packed in a wooden box which has a lock in it which can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle written on the paper note which is pasted on the top of the box by Vivek. 

Sita is stuck with this puzzle, help her in solving it.

The puzzle description is as follows:

R(n) is a function as follows,

R(0) = 1, R(1) = 1, R(2) = 1

R(n) = product of all odd primes less than or equal to n (for n≤10)

R(n) = (2^(n/4) × R(n/5) × R(n/10)) *mod (10^9+7) (for n>10)*

NOTE: For every fraction, the ceiling value is taken for evaluation. (eg: ceil(4.05) = 5, and ceil(4.9) = 5)

Consider an example: 

R(15) = 2^⌈15/4⌉ × R(⌈15/5⌉) × R(⌈15/10⌉) = 2^4 × R(3) × R(2) = 48

Now the puzzle is that you are given n and you have to find out the maximum value of x^y mod (10^9 + 7) such that non negative integers x and y satisfy the relation gcd(x,y) = R(n), where x, y ≤ 5 × R(n)

Here, gcd is the greatest common divisor. Where gcd(0,0) = 0, 0^0 = 0.

Input Format

1024

Example Explanation

x & y for both the inputs (1&2) can be 1 to 5, and the max value for x^y is when x = 4 and y = 5

SAMPLE INPUT
1
14

SAMPLE OUTPUT
996023990

Explanation

R(14) = 48, x & y can be from 1 to 48×5 (=240). the maximum value of (x^y) mod (10^9 + 7) is when x = 240 and y = 96.
