In a parallel world,there is an peaceful college, where everyone is united to everyone.
But in recent times due to some unseen circumstances, there has been fights between some friends and due to this the college is no more that united.

In the college, an announcement need to be made.
But due to the fights some students do not talk to each other.
Announcement will be told to one student and will be asked to deliver to all other students, but since he does not talk to one or many students, he will not be deliver the announcement to every student in the college.He will deliver the announcement to all his friends and then ask them to tell the announcement to their friends, In this way it will take some time for the announcement to get delivered to some other person.

Consider that if a student gets a announcement at time t then all his friends will get the announcement at time t+1.

Given two students, if news is given to student a at time 0, calculate the time at which the student b will get the news for the first time.
