On a rod of length a+b+c, lengths a, b, c are measured at random. Your task is to calculate the probability that no point of the measured lines will coincide.

INPUT:

First line contains the number of test cases T, followed by T lines, each line contains three space separated integers a, b, c.

OUTPUT:

For each test case, display the desired result in the form of m / n in a single line.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100000

NOTE: If "m" and "n" are divisible to each other, then do not divide them. e.g. If your answer is 2/4, do not solve further. Print only "2/4" not "1/2".

SAMPLE INPUT
1
1 1 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1 / 4

Explanation

If all the segments have equal length, then the probability will be 1/4.
