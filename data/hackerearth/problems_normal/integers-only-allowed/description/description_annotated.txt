You have a polygon described by coordinates of its vertices. Can you find how many points with integer coordinates lay strictly †inside‡ it?

Input
The first line contains an integer N - number of vertices.
Next N lines contain 2 space-separated integers each and describe polygon vertices in clockwise order. Note that polygon can be convex and non-convex as well.

Output
Output one integer - answer for the problem
