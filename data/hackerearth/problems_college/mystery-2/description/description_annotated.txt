We have an unsolved mystery this time too! 

†Input:‡ 

First line of input contains T – the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain two integers a and b separated by a space.

†Output:‡

Output T lines, each containing a single integer that is the output of that test case.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ T ≤ 300

1 ≤ a ≤ 999

5 ≤ b ≤ 8
