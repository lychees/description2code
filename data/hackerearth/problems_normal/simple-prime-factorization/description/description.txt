For each test case, you will be given an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

Output
Print a string showing prime factors which should look like :
2^e1 * p2^e2 * .........* pk^ek 
where p1, p2, ...., pn are the prime factors and e1, e2, ....., en is the degree of corresponding prime factor.

Note: power of 2 should always be given.
For a prime number , only 2^0 is printed.
