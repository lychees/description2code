Lucky numbers are those numbers which contain only "4" and/or "5". For example 4, 5, 44, 54,55,444 are lucky numbers while 457, 987 ,154 are not. 

Lucky number sequence is one in which all lucky numbers exist in increasing order for example   4,5,44,45,54,55,444,445,454,455... 

Now we concatenate all the lucky numbers (in ascending order) to make a lucky string  "4544455455444445454455..." 

Given n, your task is to find the nth digit of the lucky string.
If the digit is 4 then you have to print "Hacker" else you have to print "Earth".

Input:
first line contain number of test cases T , next T line contain a single interger n.

Output:
For each test case print "Hacker"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is "4" else print "Earth"(without quotes) if nth digit of lucky string is "5". 

Constraints:
1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^15
