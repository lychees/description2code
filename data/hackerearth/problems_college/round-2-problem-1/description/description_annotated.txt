One day, Penny gave Sheldon a task to solve some problems for her. Since Sheldon does not like to reject the challenges given to him, he cheerfully accepted the task he needs to perform. Now the task is he first needs to solve first solve problem 0. After solving each problem i, he must either move onto problem i+1 or skip ahead to i+2 that means he is not allowed to skip more than one problem.

Now given a int[] array, where array[i] indicates how much he likes problem i. Penny will let him stop solving problems once the range of pleasantness he has encountered reaches a certain threshold. Specifically, Sheldon may stop solving problems once the difference between the maximum and minimum pleasantness of the problems he has solved is greater than or equals to the threshold or limit. If this does not happen, he has to solve all the problems. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of problems that Sheldon must solve to fulfill the task given to him by Penny.

†Input:‡

The first line of the input contains an integer T the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a line which contains a positive integer, n. Next line contains n space separated numbers- the elements of the array[]. Next line contains an integer threshold/limit. 

†Output:‡
Output the minimum number of problems that Sheldon has to solve. 
†Constrains:‡ 
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 50
arrar[0],arrar[1] ..,array[i],..array[n-1] ≤1000
