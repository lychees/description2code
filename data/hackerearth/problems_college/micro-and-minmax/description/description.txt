Micro is a big fan of the famous competitive programmer Gennady Korotkevich, known by his handle tourist. He wants to be like him. He has been practising hard but is not reaching anywhere. So he has left his fate to one game he has, called MinMax. The game consists of an array A of N integers. If the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array A is odd, then it prints a slip with string  "Yes" written on it, otherwise it prints a slip with string "No" written on it. Now Micro decided if the output is "Yes", then one day he will surely be as good as tourist and will keep practicing otherwise he will quit. Now help Micro find the output of the game.

Input:
First line of input consists of a single integer, T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer denoting N.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
For each test case print "Yes" (without quotes), if the game's output is going to be "Yes", otherwise print "No" (without quotes). Print a new line after each test case.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10 
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \times 10^5
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 2 \times 10^7
