Good news , You have a chance to work in IRCTC as a software developer . Applications are required with a program for railway sites . sid of a station is a  something which uniquely defines it . Given N station's sid from 1 to N and distance between any two stations , if any person wants to go from station having sid A to another station C via station B as early as possible  , where time is directly proportional to distance .  What you have to do is to print the total distance and path to be covered by train if it  exists , otherwise print †"No Train Found."‡. If a railway line connects station A to B with distance d than it means it will also connects station B to station A with same distance d .

Input
First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T tests cases.  Each test case's  first line contains two integers N and k , where N is the number of stations having sid from 1 to N and k is the number of railway lines which connects stations.  Following k lines each contain three numbers  a , b and d which represents station having sid a connects station b and distance between them is d . After that a line follows with number A , B , C , where A represents sid of  the source station , C  the destination station and B is the station via which  person wants to go.

Output
For each test case , If there  exists no paths as described in problem print †"No Train Found."‡ otherwise in first line print the total distance and in second line path to be covered .
