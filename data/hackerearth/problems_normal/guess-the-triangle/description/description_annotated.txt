You are given 3 points - middles of the sides of some triangle. Find coordinates of the triangle vertices.

Input
Input  has 3 lines with 2 space-separated reals each - coordinates of the middles of the sides.

Output
Output 3 lines with 2 space-separated reals - coordinates of the triangle vertices. Each number should have exactly 4 digits after dot.  Vertices should be sorted in first coordinate ascending order. If two points have the same first coordinate than they should have second coordinate ascending order.

Constraints
0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1000

SAMPLE INPUT
5.00 3.00
4.0 4.0
5.0 5.000

SAMPLE OUTPUT
4.0000 2.0000
4.0000 6.0000
6.0000 4.0000
