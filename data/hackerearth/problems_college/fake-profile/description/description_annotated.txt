These days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as dps in Social Networking Profiles. So it is pretty hard to guess whether it is a fake profile or not.Last year, Yogesh went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

†This is his method‡: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Yogesh to determine the gender of this user by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by Yogesh's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

SAMPLE INPUT
payal

SAMPLE OUTPUT
CHAT WITH HER!
