Little Pandey is extremely protective of his wing-mates, i.e., people living in his wing.  There are †N‡ people living in his wing,  with ranks †1‡ through †N‡, one person with each rank.
Smaller rank means a better wing-man.
The same for †N‡ rooms.
They are numbered †1‡ through †N‡ and better rooms have smaller numbers.
Initially, person ranked 1 lives in room #1, person ranked 2 lives in room #2,  and so on.

Now, Pandey's best friend GJ wants to experiment with their living arrangement. He wants to arrange them such that †no wing-mate will be at room matching his rank‡. Additionally, each wing-mate will be upset if some worse wing-mate gets a better room.
For each arrangement one's rage is increased by the number of worse wing-mates with better rooms.

To irritate everyone, GJ will now try every possible way to arrange Pandey's wing-mates to satisfy the condition "no wing-mate at room matching his rank".
Note that without this condition there would be †N!‡ possible arrangements.

You've to find the total sum of the rage of the wing-mates.
