Sara and Tara were two young girls who had a really bad handwriting.So they decided to write down a word. Being highly passionate about improving their handwriting as well using there creative mind, they also wrote down the same word again but this time  starting from the last letter to the first letter with the internal letters being separated by a dash '-'.When they both grew a little more older they decided to do the same on the computer but were unsuccessful.Thus they approached you for help to display it in the similar fashion via programming. Take care that the number of letters in the  word has  minimum 3 letters.
