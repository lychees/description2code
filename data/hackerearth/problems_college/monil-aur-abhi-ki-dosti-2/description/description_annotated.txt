Jai and Veeru are best friends and are very fond of solving different problems. One day Jai decided to challenge Veeru by giving him a programming problem . Jai gives Veeru a pattern (†P‡) and a long string (†S‡) and asks Veeru to find whether there exists any †permutation‡ of the pattern (†P‡) in the string (†S‡).

†Input:‡ 
First line contains number of test cases †T‡.Each test case contains two lines ,first line contains pattern (†P‡) and next line contains a text string(†S‡).
All characters in both the strings are in lowercase only [a-z].

†Output:‡
For each test case print "YES" or "NO" (quotes for clarity) depending on whether any permutation of the pattern(P) exists in the text string(S).

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100,
1 ≤ |†P‡| ≤ 1000,
1 ≤ |†S‡| ≤ 100000.
