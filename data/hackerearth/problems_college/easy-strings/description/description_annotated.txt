The palindrome is a string that can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings "hanah", "2332" are palindromes, however the string "rahul" is not a palindrome. 

We define "Easy String" if it has an †even‡ length and the first half of this string is equal to the second half of this string. Like "dada" is an easy string because the first half "da" is equal to the second half "da", however the string "adda" is not an easy string because the first half "ad" is not equal to the second half "ad". 

If you are given a palindrome string of a particular length N, what is the †maximal possible‡ number of characters/symbols in an "easy string" that can be obtained by removing and changing the order of characters/symbols in the palindrome? 

Input

The first line of the sample input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.

Then, T lines follow.

Each line consists of a single integer N - the length of a palindrome.

Output

For each test case output a single integer - answer to the problem. 

Constraints

•   1 ≤ T ≤ 10000

•   1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000
