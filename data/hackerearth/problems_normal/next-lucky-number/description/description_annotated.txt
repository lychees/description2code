Lucky numbers are defined as the numbers consisting only of digits †3‡ and †5‡. So, given a number N, you have to print the least lucky number strictly greater than †N‡.

†Input:‡
First line of input contains number of test cases †T‡. Each test case contains a single number †N‡.  

†Output:‡
For each test case, print the next lucky number in a separate line.  

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 1000  
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^100
