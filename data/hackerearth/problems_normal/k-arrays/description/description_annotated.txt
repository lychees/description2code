Milly is feeling bored during her winter vaccations, so she has decided to do some random fun on some arrays. She will take †K‡ number of arrays of same same size †N‡. She will make all possible non-empty subsets of these arrays. She will make a Set †S‡ made up of the same-sized subsets of these arrays while considering the same indexes of the arrays . Then she will apply the operation P in each of these possible †S‡ sets. Your task is to help her  in this question.

For example, say there are 2 arrays [1, 2] , [3, 4]. So while making Sets of subsets she will make subsets of both arrays with considering only same indexes. These will be the all possible sets of subsets while considering the same indexes of both the arrays. 

                    S1 = {[1], [3]}
                    S2 = {[2], [4]}
                    S3 = {[1, 2], [3, 4]}

Now she will apply an operation †P‡ one bye one on these sets and try to find the sets having maximum as well as the minimum values of †P‡.  She is also interested in knowing the lengths of those subsets that made the resultant sets with maximum and minimum values of †P‡. There can be multiple such maximum and minimum values of †P‡ that  are possible so you have to choose the maximum value set of subsets with minimum length and minimum value set of subsets with maximum length. 

Suppose there are †K‡ arrays, so the value of †P‡ for a particular set of †X‡ - sized subsets with †i‡, †j‡ ... †m‡  indexes of those arrays is defined below :
†Q = ( (A1[i] + ... AK[i]) * (A1[j] + ... AK[j]) * (A1[m] + ... AK[m]) ) / X‡
†P = Q%(10^9+7)‡

Input
First line of the input will contain †T‡ (no. of test cases). For every test case first line will have two space separated values †N‡ and †K‡.Then the next †K‡ lines will have †N‡ space separated integers of corresponding arrays.
Output
Since your result will be two sets having maximum and minimum values of †P‡. Therefore print two space separated values. First value should be the †XOR‡ of maximum and minimum values of †P‡ and the second value should be the †XOR‡ of the length of subsets of these sets.
Constraints
†1 ≤ T ≤ 5‡ 
†1 ≤ N ≤ 16‡ 
†1 ≤ K ≤ 10‡
†0 ≤ values of arrays ≤ 10^9‡

Explanation

There are sets that can be possible. These are : 
S1 = { [1] , [3] }, so P = (1 + 3)/1 = 4
S2 = { [2] , [4] }, so P = (2 + 4)/1 = 6
S3 = { [1, 2] , [3, 4] }, so P = ((1 + 3)*(2 + 4))/2 = 12
Therefore maximum value of P is 12 with subsets of length = 2 and the  minimum value of P is 4 with subsets of length = 1. So ans will be 12 XOR 4 and 1 XOR 2.
