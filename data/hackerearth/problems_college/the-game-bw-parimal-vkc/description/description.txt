Parimal and VKC are playing a game. The scenerio is that  'N' balls are there in front of Parimal and VKC, also each ball has been given number from 0 to 9, but there is an exception for the first ball which has been given number from 1 to 9. VKC being a MathsLover calculates all the substrings of the number thus formed, one by one. If the sub-string is 'X' then Parimal has to throw 'X' candies into an initially empty box. At the end of the game, Parimal has to find out the total number of cadbaries (TOTAL )in the box. As TOTAL can be large, VKC asks Parimal to tell TOTAL % (10^9+7) instead. If Parimal answers correctly, he can keep all the cadbaries . Parimal is not so good in Maths as VKC and hence ask for your Help!
