Ramesh and Suresh are best friends. But they are fighting over money now. Suresh has given some money to Ramesh but he has forgotten how much money he had given. So Ramesh made a plan that he will give Re. 1 to every rectangle Suresh makes in a N x M area. Since Suresh is poor in mathematics he needs your help to make maximum possible rectangles in N x M area. You need to tell Suresh the maximum amount of money he can take back.
