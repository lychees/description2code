Ross, Chandler and Joey are best friends. One day they went to pond and Joey suggest them to play the game "Bamboozle". In this game they have N balls with each numbered from 0-9, but first ball is numbered from 1-9. Ross tells sub-strings 'S' formed by those balls and Chandler throws S stones into the pond. At last, Joey have to tell total how many stones Chandler throw in to the pond, 'T'.
