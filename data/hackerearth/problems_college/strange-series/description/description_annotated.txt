Jack is a great mathematician. He loves to solve series. Now Stuart gave a
series to Jack and said you have to solve the problem by making a computer program. But Jack doesn't know, how to code.

The series is:

†1 + (a1).(x)^1 + (a2).(x)^2 + (a3).(x)^3 +........+(an).(x)^n‡

And the problem is find the sum of the

†a1 + a2 + a3 +.....+ an‡

Help Jack to find the solution of the problem given by Stuart.

†HINT: Here x is the variable and the a1, a2,...  are the constants. Try to find the general solution of the problem.‡

†INPUT:‡

First line contains the number of test cases †T‡, followed by T lines, each line contains the integer value of †n‡.

†OUTPUT:‡

Display T lines denoting the desired result for each test case.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10

1 ≤ †n‡ ≤ 50
