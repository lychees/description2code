We have the following matrix 
1 0 0 0 0 0 ...
2 2 0 0 0 0 ...
3 3 3 0 0 0 ...
4 4 4 4 0 0 ... 
5 5 5 5 5 0 ... 
6 6 6 6 6 6 ...
and so on ... 

The matrix is created as follows, first row contains one 1 and rest 0's, second row contains 2 twos and rest zeros, third row contains 3 threes and so on.

Given R and C, calculate the count of even and odd numbers in sub matrix [R,C] .
0 is neither odd nor even and 1 based indexing is used i.e. matrix [1,1]=1 

Input:
First line contains number of test cases T.Each test case contains two integers R and C.

Output
For each test case print count of even and odd numbers in sub matrix [R,C].

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000  
1 ≤ R ≤ 100000 
1 ≤ C ≤ 100000
