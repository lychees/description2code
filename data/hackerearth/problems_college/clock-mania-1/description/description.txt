In Subodh's CS Deparment there is a contest of Geometry. In this contest students are told to find minimum angle between hour and minute hand.

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases, T. T lines follow, each of which contains two integer Hour hand H and minute hand M .

Output:
Print the minimum angle between the hands.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100 
01 ≤ H ≤ 12
01 ≤ M ≤ 59 

SAMPLE INPUT
2
12 30
06 00

SAMPLE OUTPUT
165 
180

Explanation

In first input time is 12:30 i.e. hour hand is in middle of 12 and 1 & minute hand is pointing at 6 which makes angle of 165 degrees. 

In Second input time is 06:00 i.e. hour hand is at 12 and minute hand is at 6 which makes angle of 180 degrees.
