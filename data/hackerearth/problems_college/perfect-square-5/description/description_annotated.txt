Shreyan is appearing for CAT examination and is stuck at a problem to find minimum value needed to be added or subtracted to make a number perfect square.You as his friend and a good programmer agrees to help him find the answer. 

†INPUT:‡

First line will contain no of test cases †T‡ (1 < T < 10000)

Next †T‡ lines will have integer †N‡ (1 < N < 1000000000000)

†OUTPUT:‡

Print YES if the †N‡ is a perfect square.

If not then print the minimum value that must be added or subtracted to †N‡ to make it perfect square with sign

SAMPLE INPUT
3
25
168
19

SAMPLE OUTPUT
YES
+1
-3

Explanation

25 is prefect square so output is YES

168 is not perfect square but if 1 is added then 169 is perfect square.

19 is not perfect square but if 3 is subtracted it becomes 16 which is a perfect square and if 6 is added it becomes 25 which is perfect square but we choose 3 as its is the minimum value
