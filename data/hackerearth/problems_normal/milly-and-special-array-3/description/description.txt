Milly is playing with an array A of size N. She wants to convert this array into a special array. In the special array, all the negative values appear at the beginning and all the other positive values form the tail of the array. In short, special array will have first negative values and then positive values. Your task is to tell her the minimum number of values that should be changed in the given array to make this one of the special array.

Note:
Special array must contain at least one negative and at least one positive value.
Special array should not contain 0 as any of it's value.

Input

First line of the input will contain T denoting the number of test cases. 
For every test case, first line will contain N. Next line contains N space separated integers denoting Ai.

Output
For every test case, print the required answer in a separate line.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ |Ai| ≤ 10^9
Here, || denotes the absolute value.

SAMPLE INPUT
2
3
1 -2 3
3
-1 1 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1
0

Explanation

Test case #1 : Change the first value in the array. 
Test case #2 : Already a special array.
