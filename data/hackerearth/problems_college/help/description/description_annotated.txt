Mr. Kumar is very passionate about competitive programming. He is participating in a programming 
contest in HackerEarth and came across an interesting problem .He found it very easy and implemented within
few minutes but couldn't get it accepted . He has already debugged his code for like hours but no luck.
He has become very frustated and now he asks for your help . Please help poor Kumar with the problem as he
is left with very little time . Here goes the problem.

You are given a pile of  n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) objects  represented by numbers 1,2,3..n 
with  1 being on top and n on the bottom . From this pile of objects, a particular object is selected
and moved to the top of the pile , preserving the order of rest of the objects. Before moving it to top you have to answer how many objects are 
lying above this selected object . This procedure is repeated m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000)  times.

 
Input
First line of input contains integer n (number of objects) and m ( number of times above specified
procedure is repeated). Each of m lines contains an integer x , representing the object which has to be moved(1 ≤ x ≤ n) .

 
Output
For each of the operation , output the required answer with newline.

 
Constraints 
1 ≤ n,m ≤ 100000
