Micro is working on a product in his internship. Name of the product is "Product". It takes an array †A‡ having †N‡ integers as input and count the number of good subsequences of that array. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A good subsequence is one in which the product of all the numbers in subsequence is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 9. Help Micro build this thing.

†Input:‡
First line of input consists of an integer denoting †N‡.
Second line consists of †N‡ space separated integers denoting the array †A‡. 

†Output:‡
Print the number of good subsequences in the array †A‡. Since the answer can be large print it modulo †10^9+7‡.

†Constraints:‡
†1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5‡
†1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^8‡

SAMPLE INPUT
6
2 3 5 6 7 8

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

Following are the subsequences, products of whose elements is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 9:
†\{2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8\}‡
†\{3, 5, 6, 7, 8\}‡
