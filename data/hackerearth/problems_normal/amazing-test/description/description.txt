Input:

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.Each testcase consist of two lines containing n and x denoting the number of students and the time given by the teacher.The next line contains n space separated numbers denoting the amount of candy each student wants.

Output:

For each testcase print YES if it is possible or NO.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 25

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

1 ≤ x ≤ 100000

0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100

SAMPLE INPUT
2
3 4
2 4 2
3 3
3 3 3


SAMPLE OUTPUT
YES
NO
