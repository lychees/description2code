John designs the following lower triangular matrix :

1 0 0 0 0 0 ...
2 2 0 0 0 0 ...
3 3 3 0 0 0 ...
4 4 4 4 0 0 ... 
5 5 5 5 5 0 ... 
6 6 6 6 6 6 ...
and so on ...

He represented this matrix as [R , C] , where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns in the matrix.

Now he provides any random R and C to Ricky and asks him to tell the count of even and odd numbers in the matrix respectively.

Note: 0 is neither even nor odd.

Input:

First line contains number of test cases T.Each test case contains two integers R and C.

Output

For each test case  print count of even and odd numbers in  matrix [R,C].

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

1 ≤ R ≤ 100000

1 ≤ C ≤ 100000
