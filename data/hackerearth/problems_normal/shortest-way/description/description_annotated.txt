The statement of this problem is quite short , apt and clear. We don't want any coder to spend time in reading a lengthy, boring story that has no connection with the actual problem. 

The problem states:

Given a pair (1,1), your aim is to get a new pair (a,b) in minimum number of operations.

There are two types of operations you can use: 

1.)  If the pair is ( x , y ) then change it to ( x+y, y )

2.)  If the pair is ( x , y ) then change it to ( x, x+y )

It is guaranteed that a and b are †co-prime‡ .

†Input:‡

The first line contains the number of test cases †T‡. 
Then, T lines follow, where each line contains †a and b‡ respectively. 

†Output:‡ 

Print a line containing the minimum number of operations required to achieve the given fraction, corresponding to each test case. 

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤10 

1 ≤ †a,b‡ ≤10^18

†a‡ and †b‡ are co-primes
