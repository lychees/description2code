Energy resources were getting depleted on the planet Kepler and Xenny was the head of the Energy Saving Committee.

Xenny was in-charge of a large piece of land, which was square in shape. The land was of size N x N. He placed square-shaped solar cells (1 x 1) on the piece of land uniformly, all over the land. Just when Xenny finished placing all solar cells, each cell received a power of K units.

Xenny worked for D days as in-charge. On each day, he performed A actions. 

In each action, he either measured the total solar power received by a set of solar cells (sub-rectangle) or set the orientation of a single cell such that its reception power became Z times the previous power.

Input:
First line contains D, the no. of days.
For each day, first line contains N and K - one side of the square piece land and initial value of reception power of each cell.
Second line contains A - no. of actions.  

Actions: 
 1. m x1 y1 x2 y2 - Measure solar powerful from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
 2. s x y Z- Set rotation of single cell (x, y), such that its reception power gets multiplied by a factor of Z.

Output:
Print the total reception power for every action in which "measurement" is done, modulo 10^9 + 7.  

Constraints:
1 ≤ D ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ 100
1 ≤ A ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ N
x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2
1 ≤ Z ≤ 100
(Note: x1, y1, x2, y2 are 1-indexed)

Explanation

Initial powers of solar cells:

1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Measured power of cells from (1, 1) to (1, 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

After setting orientation of (1, 2):

1 3 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Measure power of cells from (1, 1) to (1, 3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
