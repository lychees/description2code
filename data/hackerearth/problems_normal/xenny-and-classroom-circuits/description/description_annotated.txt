Xenny was a teacher and his class consisted of †N‡ boys and †N‡ girls. He took all his students to the playground and asked them to stand in a straight line. The boys and the girls formed a perfect line, but Xenny seemed unhappy. He wanted them to form an alternating sequence of boys and girls, i.e., he wanted that after a boy, there should be a girl in the line, and vice-versa.

In order to form an alternating sequence, a boy and a girl could swap their positions.

Given the original sequence in which the boys and girls were standing, find the minimum number of swaps required to form an alternating sequence.

Note: An alternating sequence can start either with a boy or a girl.

Input
First line of input consists of a natural number †T‡ - the number of testcases.
†T‡ testcases follow. For each testcase:

First line consists of a single integer †N‡ - the number of boys, and the number of girls.
Second line consists of a string of length †2N‡, representing the original sequence.
In this string, a boy is represented by uppercase character †B‡ and a girl by †G‡.

Output
For each testcase, print the minimum number of swaps required to get an alternating sequence on a new line.

Constraints
†1 ≤ T ≤ 5‡

†1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6‡

SAMPLE INPUT
1
2
BBGG

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1

Explanation

The first boy from left  can swap his position with the first girl from right to get the sequence:

†GBGB‡

This is an alternating sequence and it was obtained using 1 swap.
