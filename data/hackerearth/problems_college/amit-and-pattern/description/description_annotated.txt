Amit has been practicing "pattern printing" problems a lot. To test his ability Jitendra gives him a problem.He tells him to print the given matrix in the diagonal fashion.

†Note:‡ Direction of the diagonal is from the upper-right corner to lower-left corner.See sample test cases for more clarification.Imagine you are Amit. Write the code to prove your ability!

†Input:‡

First line contain the values of N and M.

Next N lines contain M space separated numbers.

†Output:‡

Print the given matrix in the diagonal fashion as described.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ N,M ≤ 100

0 ≤ element of matrix ≤100
