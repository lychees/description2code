Professor Sharma gives the following problem to his students: given two integers X( ≥ 2) and Y( ≥ 2)
 and tells them to find the smallest positive integral exponent E such that the decimal expansion of X^E begins with Y.
For example, if X = 8 and Y= 51, then X^3 = 512 begins with Y= 51, so E= 3. 
Professor Sharma has also announced that he is only interested in values of X such that
X is not a power of 10. The professor has a proof that in this case, at least one value of E exists for any Y.
now your task is to perform professor's theory and check his theory for different values of X and Y .

Input :
The first line contains the number of test cases N(0<N ≤ 9).
For each test case, there is a single line containing the integers X and Y.

Output :
For each test case, print the case number, followed by a space and a  colon, followed by a single space, followed by a single integer showing the value of the smallest exponent E.

Constraints
         1<T<10 
         2<X,Y ≤ 10^5

SAMPLE INPUT
2
5 156
16 40

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Case 1: 6
Case 2: 3

Explanation

Case 1: 
55 = 255 =1255 = 6255 = 3125*5 = 15625 =  6
so after 6 turns we gets our answer cos 156 is present in 15625.

Case 2: 
1616 = 25616 = 4096 = 3
so after 3 turns we gets our answer  cos 40 which is present in 4096
