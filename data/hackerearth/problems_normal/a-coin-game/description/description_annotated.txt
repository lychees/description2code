Rahul and Rashi are bored with playing the game of Nim, particularly after Rahul gained a thorough understanding of game theory, and would always win.

Now, they are going to play on a variation. 
There are only 2 piles of coins. Each player can make the following move:
Pick †K ( ≥ 1)‡ coins from pile 1.
Pick †K ( ≥ 1)‡ coins from pile 2.
Pick †K ( ≥ 1)‡ coins from pile 1 as well as pile 2.

As with the older version, the person unable to make a move shall lose. Can you help analyse this game for the novice, Rashi.

†Input Format:‡

The first line contains an integer †T‡, denoting the number of test cases to follow.
The next †T‡ lines each contain two integers †N1‡ and †N2‡, separated by a single space, denoting sizes of first pile and second pile respectively. 

†Output Format:‡ 

The output file should contain exactly †T‡ lines.
Output †Play‡, if Rashi would win as the first player and †Don't Play‡, if she shall lose.

†Constraints:‡

†1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5‡
†0 ≤ N1, N2 ≤ 10^6‡
