Paul was the most famous character in Tekken-3. Of course he went to college and stuff. In one of the exams he wasn't able to answer a question which asked to check if a tuple of 3 non negative integers constituted a Primitive Pythagorian Triplet or not.  Paul was not able to answer it correctly and henceforth, he could not concentrate on any fight for a very long time and lost most of them. So, he decided to learn everything about Primitive Pythagorian Triplets.

Now, Paul seeks your help to determine whether a given triplet is a Primitive Pythagorian Triplet or not.

INPUT :  

The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T.
Every test case has a single line containing 3 space separated integers a,b and c.

OUTPUT :   

The output to each test case is a "YES" or a "NO".

CONSTRAINTS :   

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 10000000

NOTE:
A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime.
