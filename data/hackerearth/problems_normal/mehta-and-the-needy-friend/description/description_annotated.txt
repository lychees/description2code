Mehta was doing his usual office work when all of a sudden, he refreshes his Gmail. It contained the mail of his not so old friend who was still jobless and asking Mehta for a certain help. His Friend Verma had applied for a certain hiring challenge for some certain company. So, Verma gave Mehta a link of the contest which contained the following question. So, you being a colleague of Mehta decide to help him with his friend's task.

†Task:‡ 
Given three integers †A‡, †B‡ and †K‡, you need to report the †K‡^th number between †A‡ and †B‡(both inclusive), satisfying the property that: the number does not contain a digit 'zero' and product of digits of number is a perfect square. If there doesn't exist that †K‡^th number output "†-1‡"(without quotes).

†Input:‡
First Line contains the number of test cases †T‡.
Next †T‡ lines contain 3 space separated integers †A‡, †B‡, †K‡ as mentioned in the task.

†Output:‡
Output †T‡ lines as answer for every test case.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100
1 ≤ †A‡ ≤ †B‡ ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ †K‡ ≤ 10^7

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 10 4
8 14 2
1 1000 23

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-1
11
119

Explanation

Sample Case#1:  {1,4,9} are the only numbers that satisfy above property, so there is no 4th number, hence answer is -1. 
Sample Case#2: {9,11,14} are three numbers in range [8,14] which have product of digits as perfect square, so, 2nd number in range [8,14] will be 11.
