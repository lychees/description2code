Given an array A of N numbers, find the number of distinct pairs (i, j) such that j ≥i and A[i] = A[j].

First line of the input contains number of test cases T. Each test case has two lines, first line is the number N, followed by a line consisting of N integers which are the elements of array A.

For each test case print the number of distinct pairs.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6 

-10^6 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6 for 0 ≤ i < N
