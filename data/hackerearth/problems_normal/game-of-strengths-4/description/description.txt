Andrew is very fond of Maths.He has N boxes with him,in each box there is some value which represents the Strength of the Box.The ith box has strength A[i].
He wants to calculate the Overall Power of the all N Boxes.

Overall Power here means Sum of Absolute Difference of the strengths of the boxes(between each pair of boxes) multiplied by the Maximum strength among N boxes.
Since the Overall Power could be a very large number,output the number modulus 10^9+7(1000000007).

Input

First line of the input contains the number of test cases T.  It is followed by T test cases.
Each test case has 2 lines. First line contains the number of boxes N. It is followed by a line containing N elements where ith element is the strength of Andrew's ith box.

Output

For each test case, output a single number, which is the Overall Power for that testcase.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9

SAMPLE INPUT

4 5 3 1 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
100

Explanation

For 1st test case sum of absolute difference between strength  is 1.So Overall Power would be 2.

For 2nd test case sum of absolute difference between each pair of boxes is 20.So Overall Power is 100.
