Ram has a candy bar that he really wants to eat. However, there is a polynomial written on the wrapper which he has to solve. If he doesn't , then the candy will no longer be sweet and turn bitter. The question on the wrapper is that if x is the least non negative integer satisfying the polynomial Ax^2+Bx-C ≥ 0, then calculate the factorial of x. Help Ram eat his candy!
