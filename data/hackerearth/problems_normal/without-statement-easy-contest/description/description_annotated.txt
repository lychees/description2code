Unfortunately someone has come and eaten the problem statement. Are you good enough to solve it without the statement?

Input
The first line contains †T‡ denoting the number of test cases.
The next  †T‡ lines describe test cases and contain two integers each: †N‡ and †M‡.

Output
For each test case output one integer - answer for the question.

Constraints
†T ≤ 1000‡
†1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^9‡

†Note:‡
N, M ≤ 1000 for 30% of the test
