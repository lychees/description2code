Mehta is a forever alone and desperate guy. He has a crush on †N‡ girls of his society. He wants to impress them all and so he needs to do their task collectively.All the girls give him a number which he stores in an array named †A‡ of size †N‡. To do their task, he has to report the number of triplets †(i,j,k)‡ in the array †A‡, with † i‡ < †j‡ < †k‡ such that the triplets have at least one prime digit in common.

†Input & Output:‡

The first line of the input contains an integer †N‡. The next †N‡ lines has a number on each, which denote the array †A‡.

You need to print on one line, the number of triples with the condition mentioned in the problem statement.

†Constraints:‡

†1 ≤ N ≤  10 ^ 5‡
†0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10  ^ {18} ‡ for all index †i‡ in the array †A‡.

†Sample Input:‡

5
21
22
23
24
25

†Sample Output:‡
10

SAMPLE OUTPUT
10

Explanation

In the given sample each †i,j,k‡ has one prime digit common that is †2‡. So, total triplets are †5C3‡ which is †10‡.
