Sherlock and Watson are close friends. One day, they finally got bored of playing normal games.

So, they came up with a new idea of playing with numbers. 
Since they are good at number theory, they know the fact that a decimal number "A" can be represented as sum of 2's powers.

For example:

    22 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1
    13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0
    15 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0

So, they define the rules of game to be played as follows:

1 - If a player has a number "N" on his turn , then he can subtract "r" from "N" if "r" comes in the 2's power expansion of "N".

For example: If "N" = 22 , then possible values of "r" can be 16, 4, or 2. So, the player can subtract any possible of "r" from "N".

2 - After subtracting, the value "N" changes. The next player player plays with the new "N" value.  

3 - The game is played until any one of the player is unable to make a move.

4 - The person who cannot make a move, loses the game.

5 - The winner of the last game, makes the first move in the next game.

As Sherlock and Watson are smart, so they play optimally. Sherlock makes first move in the first game and they both play alternatively.

Input:

    First line contains an integer "t" denoting the number of test cases.
    First line of each test case contains an integer "N".

Output:

    Print "Sherlock" if Sherlock wins the game , otherwise "Watson", on a separate line for each test case

Constraints:

    1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6
    0 < N < 2^64

SAMPLE INPUT
2
1
2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Sherlock
Sherlock

Explanation

In test case 1, Sherlock can subtract 1 and hence wins the game.
In test case 2, Sherlock can subtract 2 and hence wins the game.
