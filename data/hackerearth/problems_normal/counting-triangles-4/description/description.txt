Abhimanyu simply drew two triangles, as shown in the picture below-
He says this, Level 1 Triangles.

Then he drew two more triangles, as shown in the picture below-
He says this, Level 2 Triangles.

Similarly he defined Level 3, 4, 5, ..., N Triangles. You simply need to tell him total no. of triangles in Level N Triangle.

Input:
First line contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains a single integer the level of triangle N. 

Output:
For each test case print total number of triangles.

Constraints:
There are three types of test files.
Type1:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
Type2:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3
10^6 < N ≤ 10^12
Type3:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^2
10^12 < N ≤ 10^16
