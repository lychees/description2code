Ruchi is doing her undergrad in Maths from a reputed college in New Delhi. Recently her professor gave her a problem which is baffling her for a long time. So she asks your help.

Problem is:

Given order of n x n matrix is it possible to find two matrices such that when there corresponding elements are combined in the form of (x,y), the resulting matrix yield all n x n pairs i.e all pairs of {1,2,3,.....,n} X {1,2,3,......,n}.

For example:

n=3
Two possible matrices are:

A

1 2 3  
3 1 2   
2 3 1   

B  
1 2 3 
2 3 1
3 1 2  

Now, when we combine the corresponding elements, we get the following matrix.

C
(1,1) (2,2) (3,3)
(3,2) (1,3) (2,1)
(2,3) (3,1) (1,2)

Matrix C contains all the element of set {1,2,3} X {1,2,3}. So, ans for this order will be "Yes". 

[Note:] :Each value from 1 to n appear in each row and column once. 

[Input]
First line of the input contain integer t denoting no.of test cases.
Next t line contains a single integer n denoting the order of the matrix.

[Output]
For each test case output "Yes" if it is possible else print "No".

[Constraints]
1 ≤ t ≤ 1000000
2 ≤ n ≤ 1000000

This problem is dedicated to my friend Ruchi on her birthday (19th June). She is doing her undergraduate in Mathematics. :)

Note:
Use printf / scanf instead of cin and cout .

SAMPLE INPUT
1
3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Yes
