Problem

Bajirao wants to protect Guruji and for that he has arranged a special force
of expert officers. But Baba is also an intelligent enemy of Bajirao and he has
also arranged a bunch of expert shooters from foreign countries.

Every man has some experience points. In this scenario Bajirao's men have even experience points and Baba's men have odd experience points.

Now, Bajirao's strategy is to place his men in ascending order so that if enemy is going to attack then the more experienced men can easily takeover the enemy.

But Baba also has a stratergy. Baba will send his force in a descending
order of experience points so that their motive of killing Guruji will be
achieved , as, even if the more experienced ones die the less experienced ones can reach inside and kill Guruji.

Now, you have been given an array of experience points of
men and you have to find the men belonging to Bajirao's Force and
Baba's Force and print their experience points in appropriate order.
