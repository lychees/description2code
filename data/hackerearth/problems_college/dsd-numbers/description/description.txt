Bob likes DSD Numbers.DSD Number is a number which is divisible by its Digit Sum in Decimal Representation.

digitSum(n) : Sum of digits of n (in Decimal Representation)

eg:  n = 1234  then digitSum(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

DSD Number is number n such that  n % digitSum(n) equal to 0

Bob asked Alice to tell the number of DSD Numbers in range [L,R] inclusive. Alice does not know the answer,So she asked her Coder friend i.e you for the help. Help Her !!
