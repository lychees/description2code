You are given †T‡ test cases.
In each of them you are given four integers †N‡, †L‡, †R‡ and †X‡.
Your task is to count modulo †10^9+7‡ the number of sequences of integers †A‡ satisfying the following conditions:
1) †A‡ should contain exactly †N‡ elements.
2) †L ≤ A1 ≤ A2 ≤ ... ≤ AN ≤ R‡
3) the least common multiple of all numbers in †A‡ should be divisible by †X‡.

Input format
The first line contains one integer number †T‡, denoting the number of test cases.

Each of the next †T‡ lines contains four integers †N‡, †L‡, †R‡, †X‡.

Output format
For each test case find the answer and print it modulo †10^9+7‡ in a separate line.

Constraints
†1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ L, R, X ≤ 10^9‡
