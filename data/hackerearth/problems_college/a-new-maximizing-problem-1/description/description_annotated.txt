This time †Panda‡ is doing great. He is good with mathematical problems. His teacher decided to puzzle him with summation problems.  

Consider the following definitions, assuming 1-based indexing:  

In the computation of B, one can choose +1 or -1 to multiply, for each arr[i].
Also, you are allowed to re-order the elements of †arr‡, beforehand.

Help him find the maximum possible value of C.

†Input Format‡
The first line contains †T‡, the number of test cases.
Then †N‡ numbers follow.  

†Output Format‡
Output the query of †Panda‡ in single line. Since the answer can be very large, †mod it with 1000000007‡.  

Constraints 

†1 ≤ T ≤ 10‡
†1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5‡
†-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9‡ 

†Instructions‡
Write modular code  
Comment your code properly
