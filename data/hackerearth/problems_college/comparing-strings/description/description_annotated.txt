You are given two strings, A and B. Find if there is a substring that appears in both A and B.

Input

The first line of the input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Then there will be T descriptions of the test cases. Each description contains two lines. The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.

†OUTPUT‡

For each test case, display YES (in a newline), if there is a common substring. Otherwise, display NO.

†CONSTRAINTS‡

All the strings contain only lowercase Latin letters.
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ |A|,|B| ≤ 10^5

SAMPLE INPUT
2
hello
world
hi
world

SAMPLE OUTPUT
YES
NO

Explanation

For the 1st test case, the letter †o‡ is common between both strings, hence the answer †YES‡.

For the 2nd test case, hi and world do not have a common substring, hence the answer †NO‡.
