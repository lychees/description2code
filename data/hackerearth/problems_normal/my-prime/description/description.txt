Recently you invented a brand-new definition of prime numbers. For a given set of positive integers S let's call X a prime if there are no elements in S which are divisors of X (except  X itself).

You are given a set S. Find elements in it which are prime numbers for this set.

Input
The first line contains one integer N - size of the set S.
The second line contains N space-separated integers - elements of S. All the numbers are pairwise different.

Output
Output one line: elements of S which are prime numbers for this set in the order they occur in the input. Separate them by whitespaces.

Constraints
N ≤ 100
1 ≤ S[i] ≤ 10^6 (1 ≤ i ≤ n)

SAMPLE INPUT

10 5 3 15 16

SAMPLE OUTPUT
