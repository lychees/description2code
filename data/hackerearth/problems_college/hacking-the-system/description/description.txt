Rakesh, a student who is good at hacking finds a breach in the system and has got the access the modify any 1 digit of the guessed number, but this access is only granted after the number has been entered by a player. 

So, at the event, the computer thinks of a number A, a friend of Rakesh enters a number B and Rakesh changes one digit of the number A, so that his friend wins. You are given two integers A and B. Print "wins" if there is a possibility that the friend will win by changing of a digit, otherwise, print "loses". If the numbers A and B are same print "wins".
