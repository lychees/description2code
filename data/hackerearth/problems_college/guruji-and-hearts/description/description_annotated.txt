My good friend Guruji once submitting his code on forum mistakenly forgot to check language option. His code got pasted in general editor. Due to this many portion of his code got changed. One funny thing which happened was that sub-string "<3" got changed into a heart.
Your job is simple, count the number of "<3"(quotes for clarity) in a given string.
