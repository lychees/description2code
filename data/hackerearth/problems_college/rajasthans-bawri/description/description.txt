Bawris, are wells or ponds in which the water may be reached by descending a set of steps. They may be covered and protected and are often of architectural significance. 

Rajasthan has a history of maintaining bawris, but now they are of architectural significance hence ASI is interested to save a historic bawris from ACID rain. Hence they need to cover each and every bawri with a plank in order to prevent any direct damage to the bawri, so you are given a certain number of planks with different sizes (all rectangular), you are also given the sizes of all the bawris which are also rectangular in shape.

You have to tell whether it is possible to cover the bawri with the given plank while following these rules :
You may rotate the plank, but you must place it so that the sides of the plank are parallel to the sides of the bawri.
Plank must cover the whole bawri
Every corner of the plank must be strictly outside the bawri, i.e. boundaries of plank and bawri cannot match as acid rain water can peep inside.

Input:
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, which is followed by T number of lines.

Each line denotes one test case which has four space separated integers pX pY bX bY which are plank's length & width and bawri's length & width respectively.

Output:
For each test case, you have to output in one line either "Possible" if it is possible to cover the bawri with the plank otherwise print "Not Possible" (Quotes are for clarity)

Constraint:

100 ≤ T ≤ 10,000
1 ≤ bX, bY, pX, pY ≤ 1000

SAMPLE INPUT

2 7 4 7
5 2 3 1
9 2 7 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Not Possible
Possible
Possible

Explanation

Sample Test Case #1 :

It is impossible to cover up a bawri of size (4 X 7) with the given plank of size (2 X 7).

Sample Test Case #2 :

It is possible to cover up the bawri with the given plank.

Sample Test Case #3 :

As in the case #2
