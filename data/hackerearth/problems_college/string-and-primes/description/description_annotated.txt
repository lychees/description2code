Dark completed with studying †Strings‡ last night and trying to solve the problem of primes numbers from last three months but did not succeed every time he preferred to ask your help and same goes this time.

He likes to play a game with PRIMES AND STRINGS and he named the game as †"PRIME ASCII CHARACTERS"‡.

The rules are  as simple as finding the primes.

He wants you to read a string and delete all the characters whose ASCII VALUES is found to be a prime number.

Input:

The first line contains †T‡, the number of test cases.
Followed by †T‡ lines each contains a single string †'S'‡.

Output:

For every test case print the string by removing the †PRIME ASCII CHARACTERS‡.

print "†NULL‡" If all the characters of a string are prime ascii characters.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100000

Note: String contains only Alphabets both †UPPER & LOWER CASES‡.
