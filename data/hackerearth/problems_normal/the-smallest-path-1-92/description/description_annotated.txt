†Maga‡ gives a hard problem to †Alex‡. And Alex couldn't solve yet. Could you help him?

The †grid‡ is †n‡ by †m‡. Each cell contains a unique number on it. †Maga‡ is at the †left-top‡ and wants to go to †right-bottom‡. But there is a condition. Maga can go through only two way - †right‡ and †down‡. And the path of your move is called the nodes you have passed through over them. The path is called †the most beautiful‡ if the following condition is satisfied: The sorted of the path has to be †lexicographic smallest‡ as possible as. Output †the most beautiful path‡ for given grid.

Input:
In the first line you are given two numbers: the dimensions of grid - †n‡ and †m‡.
The next †n‡ lines contains †m‡ numbers. Each number is unique.

Output:
Output †the most beautiful path‡.

†Contraints‡:
†1‡ ≤ †n‡,†m‡ ≤ †1000‡
†1‡ ≤ †A[i][j]‡ ≤ †n*m‡, All of the numbers in the grid are unique.

SAMPLE INPUT
2 2
4 2
3 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1 2 4

Explanation

There are 2 ways to reach at (2,2) cell. The pathes are 4, 3, 1 or 4, 2, 1 respectively. So The most beautiful of them is 4, 2, 1 because if looking the sorted of them it looks like these : 1, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 4 respectively. So 1, 2, 4 is lexicographic smaller than the other. So the ans is 1 2 4.
