So he decide to avoid eating bad Snacks. But he needs your help to achieve this. He will give you an integer N (Number of Snacks he brought) and the an array D of floating-point values telling that he thinks ith number of Snack can be faulted with a chances of D[i]. And an array F containing floating-point values denoting that chances if ith Snack is faulted then Overall Snack will be faulted by F[i].

Then your task is to answer him the indexing value you think that can have faulted Snack followed
by a space with the probability of the Snack to be faulted.

Note that, Probability should have three decimal after floating-point.

Input : First line will contains an Integer T , number of Test Cases. Next T lines will have one integer N. The next two lines will contain N flaoting-point values , D[] and then F[]

Output : For each Test Case give the output in new line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤25

3 ≤ N ≤ 30

0.0 ≤ D[i], F[i] < 1.0
