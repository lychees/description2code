Limak is a little polar bear, who isn't afraid of geometry.
He has †n‡ 2-dimensional non-zero vectors †\vec{a_1}, \vec{a_2}, \ldots, \vec{a_n}‡, each described by two integers †x_i, y_i‡.
Show him that you can count ways to choose an ordered triple of distinct indices †i, j, k‡ satisfying the two conditions:
†\vec{a_i}‡ is perpendicular to †\vec{a_j} + \vec{a_k}‡
†\vec{a_j}+\vec{a_k} \ne 0‡

If you don't know vectors (so you don't understand what is written above) then you can use the following three conditions, equivalent to those given above:
For fixed †i, j, k‡ let †A, B, S‡ denote points †(x_i, y_i), (x_j + x_k, y_j + y_k), (0, 0)‡ respectively.
†\measuredangle ASB = 90^{\circ}‡
†B \ne S‡

Input format
The first line contains one integer †n‡ — the number of vectors.

The †i‡-th of next †n‡ lines contains two integers †x_i, y_i‡ — coordinates of †\vec{a_i}‡.

Some of †n‡ vectors may be equal to each other but none of them is equal to †\vec{(0, 0)}‡.

Output format
In one line print the number of ordered triples of distinct indices †i, j, k‡ satisfying the given conditions.

Constraints

Explanation

There are †n = 5‡ vectors in the sample test.
Note that some of them may be equal.
There are †4‡ ways to choose a triple of indices:
†(1, 2, 4)‡ because †\vec{a_1} = \vec{(1, 1)}‡ is perpendicular to †\vec{a_2} + \vec{a_4} = \vec{(1-2, 0+1)} = \vec{(-1, 1)}‡
†(1, 4, 2)‡
†(1, 4, 5)‡
†(1, 5, 4)‡
