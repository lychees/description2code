He might be the fastest man alive on earth but not while travelling through time.

Reverse_flash is out to kill Flash's Mother who is in a different time zone.Now Flash to save his mother must reach her before Reverse_flash.
He had a map with him -->Map of different time zones. Flash takes a certain amount of time to cross a timezone. You have to simply show if Flash could save his mother or not?

1st line -- No. of Test cases T ( 1 < = T < =1000).
2nd line -- M and N denoting no. of rows and columns.-->A matrix Map.
M lines -- Each line has N +ve integers denoting amount of time it takes for Flash to cross  that timezone (i,j)
Last line -- Three +ve integers -->x,y,t . 
(x,y) -->timezone where his mother is present.
t --> Total time it takes for Reverse_flash to reach the given timezone.

Remember that the  timezone of Flash and Reverse_flash is given by (1,1).

Print NO if he couldn't save his mother.
If he is able to save print YES and a newline and then print the time taken by Reverse_flash to reach Flash's mother after Flash reaches her.

Input constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ M ≤ 1000

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
Notes

He is not allowed to move diagonally.
Time taken by Reverse_flash to reach Flash's mother after Flash reaches her can be zero i.e both reach at the same time , even then Flash saves her.
The time of the timezone of mother is also added to reach her.
