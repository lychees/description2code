Let's call the following   †3x3‡ integer matrix transformation an †MMD-transformation‡ in 0-based indexation:
Anew [i][j] = sum ( A[x][y] * †f(i, j, x, y)‡ ) through all pairs x, y from 0 to 2 where †f(i, j, x, y)‡ ) †= |i - x| + |j - y| + |i + j - x - y|‡ 
You are given a 3x3 matrix A0.  Let's denote by An matrix A0 after N MMD-transformations with elements modulo 10^9 + 7 . Your task is to find and output An.

Input
The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case starts with line containing one integer N. Then 3 lines containing 3 integers each - matrix A0.

Output
For each test case output matrix An in 3 lines containing 3 integers each.  Don't forget that elements should be found modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints
T ≤ 30 000
Initial elements of matrix A are from 0 to 99
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12
1 ≤ N ≤ 20 in 30% of the test data.
