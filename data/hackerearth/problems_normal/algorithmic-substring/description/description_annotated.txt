In Mathematics arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two consecutive numbers is constant. 

You are given a sequence †A‡ that consists of †N‡  integers: A1, A2, .., AN. You are allowed to do a single type of operation: increase or decrease an arbitrary element Ai exactly by 1. 

Your task is calculate the minimum number of operations needed to change a substring †A‡ [†L‡, †R‡] into an arithmetic sequence in which two consecutive elements differ exactly by †K‡. That means, after applying  operations needed following condition should be satisfied:  AL + 1 - AL = AL + 2 - AL + 1 = ... = AR - AR - 1 = †K‡. 

Input

The first line is †T‡ - the number of test cases. Then †T‡ test cases follow. 

Each test consists of several lines. The first line consists of two integers †N‡ and †K‡ — the number of elements in the sequence †A‡ and the desired difference between two consecutive elements in arithmetic sequence. The second line contains †N‡ integer numbers A1, A2, .., AN. The next line contains a single   integer †Q‡ —  the number of queries you have to answer. Then †Q‡ lines follow, each containing two integers †L‡ and †R‡.

Output

For every query print the minimum number of operations needed to change substring †A‡ [†L‡, †R‡] into an arithmetic sequence where any two consecutive elements differ exactly †K‡.
