Roy has a wooden log (tree trunk) of length †L‡ units. 
Since the log is too heavy for him to lift, he wants to cut it into pieces. 

He can lift pieces of length †1‡ or †2‡ units. 

He wonders in how many ways can he make such pieces of the wooden log.

Now Roy is too lazy, so he would also like to finish cutting with minimum number of cuts. 

So, for given length †L‡, find 

(1) †W‡ - number of ways he can make pieces of the wooden log in lengths of 1 or 2 and 

(2) †M‡ - minimum number of cuts required. 

†Input:‡ 

First line of input will contain integer †T‡, number of Test Cases 

Next T lines each will contain integer †L‡, length of wooden log. 

†Output:‡ 

For each test case, print in a new line two space separated integers †W‡ and †M‡ 

†Constraints:‡ 

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10000 

1 ≤ †L‡ ≤ 1000000000 (10^9)

Explanation

For Sample Test #1:
Two possible ways are shown in figure, out of those two in 1st way number of cuts required is minimum, just 1 cut.

For Sample Test #2:
Out of 3 possible ways as shown, number of cuts required is minimum in 1st way, which is 1.
