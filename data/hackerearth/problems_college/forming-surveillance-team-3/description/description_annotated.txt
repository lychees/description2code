Agent †OO7‡ is engaged in a mission to stop the nuclear missile launch. He needs a surveillance team to monitor the progress of the mission. Several men with different type of capabilities assemble in a hall, help †OO7‡ to find out total men with different capabilities. Capability is represented in form of numbers.
Input - First line contains †'T'‡ test cases followed by †'T*2'‡ lines, each pair containing,
1)  Total number of men, †M‡.
2)  Capability value of each men, †A[i]‡.
Output - †'T'‡ lines containing total men with different capabilities.
Constraints - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^3,   1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5,   1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5

Explanation

1) For the †1st‡ case, 1st line contains †6‡ men followed by †6‡ different capability values, i.e., {48,11,11,48,36,10}.
Since, 48,11,36,10 are 4 unique capability values, so the output is †4‡.
2) For the †2nd‡ case, 1st line contains †4‡ men followed by †4‡ different capability values, i.e., {25,25,25,25}.
Since, 25 is the only unique capability value, so the output is †1‡.
