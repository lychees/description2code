Little Jhool is friend with the magical creature from Koi Mil Gaya as we all know, called Jaadu.  

Now, Jhool is learning Mathematics from Jaadu; he wants to know about the Mathematics of the other planet, too.  

In Jaadu's planet, the sequence of powers of two are called the: The JP. (Jaadu power!) That is, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3.... 2^{1000000}. 10,00,000 being the limit known to the people on Jaadu's planet. Also, Jhool is smart so he notices that this particular sequence starts from index 1 and NOT 0. Now since Jhool thinks that he's understood the sequence well, already so he  challenges Jaadu.

Jaadu gives him a number, denoted by N, and asks Jhool to find the number of pairs (i, j) such that (JP [i] - 1) divides (JP[j] - 1)  and 1≤ i<j ≤ N . Jhool is stunned by this difficult question. And needs your help!  

Input:
First line contains number of test cases T. Each test cases contains single integer N.  

Output
For each test case print total numbers of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤ i < j ≤ N and JP[i]-1 is divisors of JP[j]-1.  

Constraints: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10000    
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
