The Tricksters are back again with a new challenge for the Flash!!
This time they have placed bombs throughout Central city and the Flash has to disarm the bombs. There can be maximum n bombs. For disarming each bomb i, flash takes t[i] time. Also disarming bombs require energy denoted by e[i]. Each bomb has an associated value of destruction d[i]. Given that flash can spend atmost E energy and the bombs explode in T time, what is the minimum amount of destruction that the city has to suffer when the bombs explode(if the flash can disarm all bombs in T time using E energy, print 0).

Assume Flash can move from the location of one bomb to another instantaneously(He's the Flash, of course he can!!).

Input:

First line will contain 3 integers, n(1 ≤ n ≤ 100), E(1<E=100) and T(1<T=100).
The next line will contain n integers denoting e ≤ e[i] ≤ 100">i.
The next line will contain n integers denoting t ≤ t[i] ≤ 100">i.
The next line will contain n integers denoting d ≤ d[i] ≤ 10000">i.

Output:

Print the minimum destruction that the city has to suffer.
