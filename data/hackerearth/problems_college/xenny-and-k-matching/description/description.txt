Xenny had N boxes with an integer printed on each of the boxes.

He wanted to find out how many distinct pairs of boxes that were at distance k from each other, had an absolute value of difference or sum that was a multiple of k.

Help him in this task.

(Note: Consider two indices i1 and i2. Pairs (i1, i2) and (i2, i1) are not considered to be distinct)

Input Format:

First line contains 2 space-separated integers - N and k.
