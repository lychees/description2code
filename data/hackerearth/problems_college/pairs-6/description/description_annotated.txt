Motu and Chotu are Best-Friends.
They both used to play CS-GO all the time.  We know that there are two teams   , they are CT and T .As Motu got bored of playing CS-GO whole day. He found a different game to play.
Motu likes only if a CT guy stands beside a CT guy or a T guy stands beside  a T guy . But Chotu likes the opposite i.e, a T guy should stand besides a CT guy and viceversa.
There are total N no. of soldiers.
CT = total no.of soldiers in Counter Terrorists Team.
T = total no. of soldiers in Terrorists team.
Now first Motu is given the first chance to pick a soldier from N soldiers and make him stand in a separate line. Then Chotu picks a soldiers and makes him stand in a line next to the one picked by Motu.
If the total no. of pairs of soldiers of same team standing beside each other is greater than the total no. of pairs of soldiers of opposite team standing beside each other then Motu wins otherwise Chotu wins.
