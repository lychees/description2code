"""
A palindrome is a string that is the same whether it is read from left to right or from right to left. Chota Bheem likes palindromes a lot. As a birthday gift he received two strings A and B. Now he is curious if there is a way to insert string B into string A so that the resulting string is a palindrome. You agreed to help him and even tell how many different variants of such insertions exist. Two variants are considered different if string B is inserted in different places. Print the number of possible insertion variants.

Input:-
1st line input the number of testcases and next two lines of each test case contains A and B.
