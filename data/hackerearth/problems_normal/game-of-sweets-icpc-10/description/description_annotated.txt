Two kids are playing the following game: there are initially †N‡ cards and there is a non-negative integer written on the each card. They perform three steps:
The first player picks random card of the given †N‡ cards. Let's denote the number written on it as †A‡. 
The second player picks random card of the other †N - 1‡ cards. Let's  denote the number written on it as †B‡.
If †A‡ equals †B‡ then, the game ends with a draw and nobody receives candies. Otherwise the game is finished. The kid with the greatest number is claimed as the winner and he gets †|B - A|‡ sweets.

You were watching your little son playing this game and noticed that there are not many outcomes  of the game. So now you are interested in the following question: how many different values of |A-B| are possible?

Input
The first line contains one integer †N‡.
The second line contains †N‡ non-negative integers - numbers written on cards.

Output
Output the one number - answer to the question.

Constraints
†2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5‡
†0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5‡

SAMPLE INPUT
3
4 8 6

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

The winner can get †2‡ sweets if the chosen cards were †6‡ and †8‡ (or †4‡ and †6‡). He also can get †4‡ sweets if the numbers on the cards were †4‡ and †8‡.
