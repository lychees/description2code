Given †N‡ 2-Dimensional points in the form of †(x, y)‡. Sort the points in the following way. 
Two points †(x1, y1)‡ and †(x2, y2)‡ are said to be sorted with respect to each other if 
1.  †x1 < x2‡ 
2.  †x1 == x2 and y1 > y2‡ 
Input 
First line contains †T‡ (number of test cases). Next line contains †N‡ (number of points in 2-D space). Next N line contains two integers separated by a single space †X‡ and †Y‡ denoting the x-coordinate and y-coordinate respectively.
