Byteland consists of N houses numbered 1..N. The house †i‡ has †K[i]‡ members living in it. There are also †M‡ roads connecting some pairs of houses. The roads are all bidirectional and each road has a certain length. There is a candy shop located in house †S‡. 

The citizens of Byteland decide to send candies to each other's houses (not to their own of-course). The amount of candies sent by house †u‡ to house †v‡ should be †K[v]‡ (one for each member of house †v‡). The owner of the candy shop, being a shrewd businessman, decides the following :
A delivery from †u‡ to †v‡ must necessarily pass through the candy shop, and it's cost will be the length of the shortest such path. 
Each candy shall be delivered independently, so the delivery from †u‡ to †v‡ will cost †K[v]‡ times the length of the shortest path from †u‡ to †v‡ through the candy shop.

Input

The first line contains three integers †N‡, †M‡, and †S‡.

The next line contains †N‡ integers, denoting the †K[]‡ values of the houses.

The next †M‡ lines contain three integers each: †u‡, †v‡, †w‡, denoting that there is a road of length †w‡ connecting house †u‡ and †v‡.

Output

Print N space separated integers in the same line, where the †ith‡ value is the total cost incurred by house †i‡.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100,000

0 ≤ w ≤ 100000

1 ≤ K[i] ≤ 100

1 ≤ u, v, S ≤ N

Note: There may be certain families who are unable to send candies to each other due to inadequate road connectivity. These incur 0 cost.

Explanation

The candy shop is at distance [2, 3, 0, inf, and 1] from houses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

House 1 delivers candies to houses 2, 3, 5 at costs †4 * 5 + 3 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 29‡. It does not deliver to house 4.

House 4 is not connected to the candy shop, so it incurs 0 cost.
