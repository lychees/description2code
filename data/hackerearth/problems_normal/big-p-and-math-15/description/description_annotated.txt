Big P is fairly good in mathematics.
His teacher has asked him to add two numbers.
Now , Big P has a problem that he †sometimes‡ writes a '†6‡' as a '†5‡' and vice versa.
Given two numbers, †A‡ and †B‡, calculate the minimum and the maximum sum Big P could possibly get. 

†Input:‡
The first and only line of input contains positive integers †A‡ and †B‡ . 

†Output:‡
In single line of output, print two space separated integers, minimum and maximum sum Big P could get. 

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †A,B‡ ≤ 1000000
