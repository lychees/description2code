The first line of the input file contains a positive integer †T‡, the number of test cases.
Then, †T‡ lines follow, each containing a single word †W‡ (no spaces, only lowercase English letters).

†Output Format‡

The output must contain exactly †T‡ lines, each line containing a single word, the required answer.

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100
1 ≤ |†W‡| ≤ 31
