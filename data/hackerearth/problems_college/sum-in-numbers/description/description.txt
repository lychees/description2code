You have to simply count total numbers in range L to R such that their sum of digits is K

Input
First line contains L,R and K as input. 

Constraints
1 ≤ L ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ R ≤ 10^18
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
L is always lesser than or equal to R

SAMPLE INPUT
2 15 4

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

4 and 13 are the two numbers with digit sum as 4 for the given range
