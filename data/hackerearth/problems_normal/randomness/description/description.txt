In this given problem, which given a positive integer M can generate any real
number between 0 to N, and Probability density function  is uniform in [0, M]. 

GIven two numbers X and Y, you need to genrate a ,b using random number generator with uniform Probability density function in [ 0,X ] and [ 0,Y ] , such that  a+b  is less than equal to C ( C is a positive Integer).

INPUT

The first line of the input is an integer N the number of test cases.

N lines follow. Each line contains 3 positive integers X, Y and C.

OUTPUT

For each Input, Output a fraction that indicates the probability. The GCD of each pair of numerator and denominator should be 1.
