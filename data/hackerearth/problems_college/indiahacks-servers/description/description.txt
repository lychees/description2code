The INDIA HACKS Organizers has just started the Contest. Initially, they don’t have any Servers. So, they started purchasing new servers to test the programs submitted by Contestant (If you want to be the contestant go to INDIAHACKS-2016).

Meanwhile, program submissions keeps on coming to the website. One server can investigate only one program then it crashes.

If there is Server free (isn't busy with debugging the program) during the submission of a program, it will go un solved.

Given the chronological order of program submissions and server purchases, find the number of programs which will go un solved by the team of INDIAHACKS.

Input
The first line of input will contain an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of events. The next line will contain n space-separated integers.

If the integer is -1 then it means a program has been submitted. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of servers purchases together at that time. No more than 10 servers will be purchased at a time.

Output
Print a single integer, the number of programs which will go untreated.
