Kevin thinks that array †A‡ is beautiful if
It contains †N‡ positive integers.
It doesn't contain any bad numbers.
There doesn't exist any number †x‡ and tuple (y1, y2, ..., yK) such that Ax = Ay1 ·  Ay2 · ...  ·  AyK (yi < x). 

Kevin knows †M‡ bad numbers †Bi‡. Kevin also knows that 1 isn't a bad number. Now he wants to find lexicographically smallest beautiful array.

†Input format:‡

The first line of the input contains three numbers N, K, M.  The next line contains M integers - Bi.

†Output format:‡

Output N integers - lexicographically smallest beautiful array.

†Constraints:‡
2 ≤ N, K ≤ 2 · 10^4 
0 ≤ M ≤ 2 · 10^4
0 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^9
N, M, K ≤ 100 in test data worth 20% of all points
M = 0 in test data worth 20% of all points

SAMPLE INPUT
7 2 3
4 7 47

SAMPLE OUTPUT
