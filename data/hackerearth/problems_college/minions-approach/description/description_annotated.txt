Minion's approach is †Correct‡, if number of the positive integers less than or equal to †N‡ that are relatively prime to †N‡, is prime or else †Incorrect‡.
In other words, let †Z‡ be the number of integers †K‡ in the range 1 ≤ †K‡ ≤ †N‡ for which the greatest common divisor gcd(N,K) = 1. If †Z‡ is prime then Minion's Approach is †Correct‡ else it is †Incorrect‡.

Given an integer †N‡, your task is to check if a minions approach is †Correct‡ or †Incorrect‡.

†Input:‡ First line contains T - number of test cases.
Each of next T lines contain an integer N.

†Output:‡ Print approach type of each N in a new line i.e. "Correct" or "Incorrect".

†Constraints:‡   1 ≤ T ≤ 10   |   1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

Explanation

For N=4, numbers ≤ 4 and relatively prime to 4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 numbers that are relatively prime to 4. Since 2 is a prime. Approach is Correct.

For N=5, numbers ≤ 5 and relatively prime to 5 are 1,2,3 and 4. So there are 4 numbers that are relatively prime to 5. Since 4 is not a prime. Approach is Incorrect.
