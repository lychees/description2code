Samba has annoyed gabbar once again. But this time gabbar has all the six bullets in his pistol. the only way for samba to escape is to give an answer to gabbar's mathematical problem. The problem is to find the number with maximum occurence in prime factorization of factorial of number n.
If more than one answer is possible then samba would have to print the largest number.hail samba !

Input

first line contains T . no of test cases 

next T lines contains n .

Output

number with maximum occurrence in prime factorization of factorial of the number 

Constraint

0 < T < 100

2 ≤ n ≤ 20

SAMPLE INPUT
1
4

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

factorial of 4 = 24 

prime factorization of 24 is 2^3*3^1

thus ans is 2
