In this problem of Googly sum nikki gives you a sequence A consisting of N integers. nikki will call the ith sequence element good if it equals to the sum of some three elements in positions strictly smaller than i . Now nikki asks you a simple question how many good elements does the sequence contain?

Note : An element can be used more than once in the sum i.e  lets say sequence is  [1 3  5  9] (indexing from 0) consider the following points - 

1) In sequence 1 is not good obviously.

2) 3 is good as 1 can be added three times to get 3

3) 5 is good as adding two times 1 and one time 3 will give 5

4) 9 is good as 1+3+5=9 and also adding element 3 three times will give 9 so any of these condition can be used to count 9 as good.

Input :

The first line of input contains the positive integer N , the length of the sequence A. The second line of input contains N space-separated integers representing the sequence A .

Output :

The first and only line of output must contain the number of good elements in the sequence.

Constraints :

1 ≤ N ≤ 5000

-10^5 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^5
