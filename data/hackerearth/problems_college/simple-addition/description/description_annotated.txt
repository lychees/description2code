Harsh just loves numbers and loves to have fun with them . Apparently he has two numbers with him , say †X‡ and †Y‡ . Both of them are integers . Now from these numbers he wants another number , say †L‡ . But he doesn’t know how to derive it and needs your help . Given the two numbers you can add one to another , and you can do this any number of times . For example, you can add †X‡ to †Y‡ , or †Y‡ to †X‡ , and this can be done until any combination makes either †X‡ equal to †L‡ or †Y‡ equal to †L‡ . 

“Well , this might actually lead to a solution”, said Harsh, ”but can you do it in a minimum number of operations ?”.

Just to make this problem a little simple let’s assume both the values of †X‡ and †Y‡ is 1 .

†Input Format:‡

The first line contains †T‡, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains †L‡ ,the value that Harsh wants .

†Output Format:‡

For each test case, output the required minimum number of operations . 

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤20
1 ≤ †L‡ ≤1000000

SAMPLE INPUT
1
3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

Explanation

Add X to Y , and then add Y to X  . Value of X is 3 and value of Y is 2 . 

The minimum number of steps is 2 .
