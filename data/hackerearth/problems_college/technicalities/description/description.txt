Bimal decided to join a non Hill'ffair club because he is not interested in cultural activities at
all. He thought that joining a technical club would help him in gaining technical prowess. However, on joining
the most technical club that he could find, he realised that most of the work in all technical clubs is
not technical. Bimal decided that instead of getting bored at meetings, he would solve
math problems at the meetings. In today's meeting at our technical club, while the members are talking about
non-technical things, Bimal is trying to find the value of  a very large number modulo 10^9 + 7. Help Bimal
find the answer. The number can have as many as 10^5 digits.

Input:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
The next T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains the number of digits that N has
The next line contains the number N

Output:
Print the value of N modulo (10^9 + 7)
