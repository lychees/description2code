A †Nice-P sequence is defined as a sequence such that a1 x a2=1 (mod p), a2 x a3=1 (mod p) ..., an-1 x an = 1 (mod p)‡. In addition, a1, a 2, a 3, ... an must be less than p and greater than or equal to 0. Given one element, †a1‡, find the sum of the entire Nice-P sequence †of length n‡. If, for any ai, where i ≥ 1, there exists no ai+1 such that ai x ai+1 = 1 (mod p), output †-1‡. 

†NOTE: p IS NOT NECESSARILY A PRIME‡

†Input:‡

The first line contains †T‡, the number of test cases.

†T‡ lines follow, each containing †a1, p, and n‡.

†Output:‡

For each test case, output one line, the required sum. 

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5 
1 ≤ a1 ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
a1 < p ≤10^9

Explanation

In the first test case, the P-interesting sequence will be 2, 2, which has a sum of 4. In the second test case, it will be 3, 5, which has a sum of 8.
