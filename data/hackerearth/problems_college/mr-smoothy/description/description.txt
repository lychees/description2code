Mr. Smoothy is a restaurant that serves mostly smoothies at which Ben and his friends are regular customers. The titular mascot is a cup with face and legs that holds a smaller cup. It serves the strangest assortment of flavors in its smoothies, made to order.
The restaurant was about to open, and there was crowd gathered around the serving window. Ben was also there. As the window opens, crowd quickly makes a line. Unfortunately Ben gets the last place. He complains that he came before many others in the line, so he should be served before them.
Similarly, many others who are standing at the back of the line start complaining.
Your task is to count number of complaints made by all. Ignore that Ben is a hero this time. Also, many persons can arrive together, so they cannot complain for each other.
