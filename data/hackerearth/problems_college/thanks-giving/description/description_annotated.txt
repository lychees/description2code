Level 1

Sometimes what happens during SBG slot booking is we forgot to book our slot and mess up. But few clubs
are generous enough to change their timings to make sure our event doesn't get postponed, hence a 
special thanks to them :).

Anyways, the question here is you are given a string of only lower-case letters,you need to find the 
character which has maximum frequency in it. If two or more characters have maximum frequency, pick the 
lexicographically smallest character.

If that character occurs in 'head rush', print '†Thanks head rush‡'.

If that character occurs in 'cubing club', print '†Thanks cubing club‡'.

If that character occurs both in 'head rush' and 'cubing club', print '†Thanks both‡'.

If that character occurs neither in 'head rush' nor in 'cubing club', print '†none‡'.
