A boy named †P‡ loves a girl named †G‡. It is the Valentine's week and Chocolate Day is approaching, so †P‡ wants to give some chocolates to †G‡ but he is afraid to give them himself. So he takes help of another girl named †S‡.

†P‡ buys some chocolates from a shop. There are †N‡ types of chocolates and there are a total of †Ai‡ chocolates of †ith‡ type where 1 ≤ †i‡ ≤ †N‡. 

Now †P‡ gives these chocolates to †S‡ and tells her to give them to †G‡ for him. However †S‡ likes chocolates so much that she eats all the chocolates and tells †P‡ that 
†G‡ refused his chocolates.

Now, †S‡ has a very peculiar way of eating the chocolates. She eats the last chocolate of type †i‡ +1 only after she has finished eating all chocolates of 
type †i‡ (for all 1 ≤ †i‡ < †N‡).

Given all the values of †Ai‡, you need to find the number of ways †S‡ can eat those chocolates. 

Chocolates of same type should be considered non distinguishable. 

†INPUT:‡

First line of input contains an integer †T‡ (1≤ †T‡ ≤ 10), the number of test cases. 

First line of each test case contains an integer †N‡ (1≤ †N‡ ≤ 1027). Next line of each test case contains †N‡ integers. 
The †ith‡ integer corresponds to the value †ai‡. (1 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 1027).
Also, total number of chocolates is less than or equal to 1027.

†OUTPUT:‡

For each test case print a single integer, the number of ways S can eat those chocolates. As the number can be very large, print it modulo †10^9+7‡.

Explanation

1st Test Case

There are 5 chocolates of Type 1. So, †S‡ has only one way of eating them.

2nd Test Case

Here, There are 3 chocolates of Type 1, 2 chocolates of Type 2 and 1 chocolate of Type 3. †S‡ can eat them in the following 4 ways:
1 1 1 2 2 3
1 1 2 1 2 3
1 2 1 1 2 3
2 1 1 1 2 3
