In this problem the word "set" will always denote a multiset (link to wikipedia).
Thus, some of its elements can be the same.
The order of elements doesn't matter.
Multisets {a, a, a, b, c, b} and {a, b, c, a, b, a} are the same.
Multisets {a, a, b} and {a, b, b} are different.

You have a set consisting of some elements. A set can either be empty, or contain other sets. Note that sets in this problem may contain multiple copies of the same set. More formally, a set satisfies the following context free grammar with start symbol S: 

S -> {T}
T -> ST | ε 

In this context free grammar, S denotes a set, while T denotes a list of the elements which are sets themselves. For example, valid sets are {}, {{}}, {{}{}}, {{}{{}{}}}.

We can define an element of a set to be one of the sets that make up the set.
For example, a set {a, a, b} has three elements, that is a, a, and b.
The set {} has no elements. The set {{}} has one element {}. The set {{}{{}{}}} has two elements {}, {{}{}}. 

Two sets are said to the same if they have the same multiset of elements. Note that the order of elements in the sets doesn't matter. For example, the sets {{}{{}}} and {{{}}{}} are the same, but the sets {{}{}} and {{}} are different. 

Call a set S transitive if x is an element of S, then all elements in x are elements of S as well.

For example, the empty set {} is transitive. The set {{}} is also transitive. However, the set S = {{{}}} is not transitive, as {{}} is an element of S, but {} is an element of {{}} but not of S. We can make it transitive by adding the element {} to the set to get the transitive set {{{}}{}}.

You’re given a string with n characters representing a set. You would like to make this set transitive with the minimum number of moves. In one move, you can either add an arbitrary set or remove an arbitrary element from S.  You are not allowed to add or remove elements in sets that are elements of S. Compute the minimum number moves you need to make the set transitive.

Input Format
The first line of the input will contain an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case will contain a single string on its own line, denoting the set.

Output Format
Print a single line per test case, the minimum number of moves required to make the set transitive.

Explanation

In the first sample, the set is already transitive, so we don't need to do anything.

In the second sample, we can add the set {} to make the set transitive.

In the third sample, we can remove both elements {{{{}}}} and {{{{}}}} to get an empty set, which is transitive.

In the fourth sample, this set has elements {}, {{{}{}}{{}}}, {{}{}}, {{{{}{}}{}}}. Note that we can only add or remove elements from the outermost set. Although we can get a transitive set by modifying the second set to {{{}{}}{}} this operation cannot be done in a single move. One optimal solution is to do the replacement in two steps, with one removal and one addition. Another optimal solution is to remove the set {{{{}{}}{}}} and add the set {{}}. This will make our set contain elements {}, {{}}, {{}{}}, {{{}{}}{{}}}, which we can verify is transitive.
