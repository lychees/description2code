Given an array A of N elements in input. Given Q queries. For each integer X in a query print YES if X is present in given array, print lower_bound and upper_bound of X.

lower_bound of an element is defined as minimum element greater than or equal to X present in array.

upper_bound of an element is defined as minimum element greater than X present in array.

Input

First line contains integer N. Next line contains N space separated integers. Next line contains integer Q (number of queries). Next Q lines contains integer X.

Output

For each query print YES if X is present in array else print NO, print value of lower and upper bound of X. If lower bound and upper bound does not exist print -1.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

-10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9

1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5

-10^9 ≤ Xi ≤ 10^9
