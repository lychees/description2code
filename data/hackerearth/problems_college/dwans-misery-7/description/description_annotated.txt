There are †N‡ pots placed in a circle, †ith‡ pot contains †Ai‡ number of chips. Dwan can pick any number of the pots, but he is not allowed to choose adjacent pots. What is the maximum number of chips he could collect?

Input

First line contains single integer †T‡ denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer †N‡ denoting the number of pots.
The second line contains †N‡ space-separated integers †A1, A2, ..., AN‡ denoting the number of chips in each pot.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum number of chips he could collect.

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 110

2 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 2.5*10^4

1 ≤ †Ai‡ ≤ 10^7

SAMPLE OUTPUT
75

Explanation

Maximum chips he could collect is 75 (A1=25,A3=25,A5=25). Pot 6 could not be picked because he had to leave pot 1 for that (as pots are arranged in a circle).
