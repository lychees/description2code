Navi got a  task at school to collect N stones. Each day he can collect only one stone. As N can be a very large number so  it could take many days to complete the task, but then he remembers that his mother gave him a magic that can double anything (i.e if he has 2 stones, the  magic will make them to 4 stones). Navi can use this magic any number of time on the collected stone on a particular day and add this to the previously collected stones. Remember that he wants exactly N stones and he can't throw any stone.  If he gets more than N stones then he gets 0 marks, of course he doesn't want 0 marks. Help him to collect exactly N stones in minimum number of days.
