Sanket is a very organized person. He likes to organize everything to increase his efficiency. Whenever he sees a list of numbers he like to tag the number in ascending order. Recently he has realized he is wasting a lot of time doing that and thus want you to help him do it faster.
Given a list of numbers [23, 45, 87, 34, 13, 76, 34] it should output another list with the order of the numbers that is [1, 3, 5, 2, 0, 4, 2].  

†Input Format‡
First line has a single integer T that is the number of testcases.
Next 2 lines contains the size of the array N a single integer , followed by the list of numbers.

†Output Format‡
For each list of size N output N integers in a single line indicating the order of numbers.

Constraints 

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
-10^9 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9
