Brio wants to get a beautiful house constructed near the National Highway. As his in laws are very much fond of triangles, he decided to give his house a perfect Triangular Shape.
Now, here comes the problem that he faces. The plots in Hackers' Land are all circular in shape. You need to help Brio find the area of the smallest plot that he should buy so as to build his triangular house.

†Input:‡ 

The first line of the input contains the number of testcases †T‡. Each of the next †T‡ lines contain †3‡ real numbers †A‡, †B‡ and †C‡ - the dimensions of Brio's House.

†Output:‡

One line per test case containing the area of the plot required upto 4 decimal places.

†Constraints:‡

†T‡ ≤ 1000
1 ≤ †A‡ , †B‡ , †C‡ ≤ 1000  

†Note : Take pi = 3.1415‡
