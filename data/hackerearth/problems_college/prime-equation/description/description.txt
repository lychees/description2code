Recently Akash got this equation. Now being curious he wanted to know that for a given N ,  is it possible to find P1, P2, P3 and P4 for below equation under following conditions.

( P1-P2 ) + ( P3 - P4 ) = N
P1, P2, P3, P4 are prime numbers
P1 and P2 are consecutive Primes and P1 > P2
P3 and P4 are consecutive Primes and P3 > P4
It is possible that P1=P3 and P2=P4 
3 ≤ P1,P2,P3,P4 ≤ 10^7

NOTE : Consecutive primes are the primes next to each other. i.e, 2 and 3 ,   7 and 11 , 17 and 19  are considered as consecutive prime numbers.

Input : 
First line contains T - No. of Test cases. 
For each test case there is only one line containing N.

output :
Output "YES" if such P1,P2,P3,P4 are possible else print "NO" in each line

Constraints : 
1≤ T ≤ 10^5 
1≤ N ≤ 10^7
P1 , P2 ,P3 , P4 ≤ 10^7
