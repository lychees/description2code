†ACT I‡
Handi Bhaiya is a very notorious kid and always troubles his parents and friends. One day his naughtiness lead him to a demon Kali(THE COBRA COMMANDER) who trapped him into a triangular magic cell. Handi Bhaiya parents want their kid back and asks for your help.

†ACT II‡
You knew that the entire humanity will hate you but then also you decided to rescue Handi Bhaiya (don't ask why). You went to Kali and asked to release Handi Bhiaya. Kali being good by heart decided to free him but you have to solve a puzzle first.

†Puzzle‡
Kali asks to write you a program that will tell whether Handi Bhaiya can be inside the given cell or not, for T(1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6) test cases. For each test case you will be given a cell(not necessarily closed and bounded) that will have 3 †integral‡ sides- †a‡, †b‡ and †c‡ representing the sides of cell. You have to tell whether Handi can be inside that cell or not. Remember that the cell was triangular in which he was trapped.
If the cell is triangular then also print the type of triangle - isosceles, equilateral or scalene. Refer given test case for sample output.
Constraints: 0<a,b,c<2^64
