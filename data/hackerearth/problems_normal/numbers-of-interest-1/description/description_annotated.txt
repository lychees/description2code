Harold always boasted about his prowess with numbers. So one day Reese challenged him to a problem. He gave Harold two numbers †X‡ and †Y‡ and asked him to find out the †N^th‡ number of the series which began with †X‡ numbers of †Y’s‡ and the following elements are equal to the sum of the last †X‡ numbers in the series. Help Harold find the  †N^th‡ number of the series. 

†Input:‡
The first line contains a number †T‡ , number of test cases.
The next †T‡ lines each contain 3 integers †X‡, †Y‡ and †N‡ separated by single space.

†Output:‡ 
For each test case print the †N^th‡ number of the sequence.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^6
0 < †N‡ ≤ 50
0 < †X‡ < 50
0 ≤ †Y‡< 3
