After decrypting the code Enigma crew came to know that there are N locations where bombs has been planted. X1, X2 …. Xn are the N locations. Among this locations, one X location is the central hub which control all the other Xn-1 location. 1 or more than 1 signal is send to N locations. The decrypted code simplified  that the X location is not divisible from the range 2 to X/2. 

Your job is to help the Enigma crew by finding the largest X location and how many times it is repeated. So, the Enigma crew can defuse the main hub.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, N, representing the number of locations.
In the second line, there are N space-separated integers X1, X2 …..Xn, representing the location of N.  

Output Format
There will be two line of output.
First line contain the largest X location.
Second line contain the number of times is repeated. 

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ X ≤ 1000000
