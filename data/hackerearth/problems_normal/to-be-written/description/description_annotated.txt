Ravi and Micro, two very good friends, had a fight today. So, Ravi challenges Micro to beat him in a game.
Ravi takes a number †n‡ to start the game.
Now, Ravi will choose †integers from 0 to n‡ sequentially (i.e.in the turn 0 he choses 0, in turn 1 he choses 1, ans so on till nth turn when he choses n).We will call this integer †r‡ for each turn.
For each turn ,the possible integers Micro can choose(in each turn, Micro can choose any number of integers) are represented by †m(0 ≤ m ≤ n)‡

The rules of the game are:
If †r+m=n‡, then Ravi gets r and Micro gets m(†value=m‡ , informally value is the part of n which Micro gets).
If †r+m<n‡, then Ravi gets r and Micro gets m and remaining is not used.(†value=m‡)
If †r+m>n‡ and:
i. If †r<m‡, Ravi gets r , Micro gets n-r.(†value=n-r‡)
ii.If †r>m‡, Micro gets m, Ravi gets n-m.(†value=m‡)
iii.If †r=m‡,Ravi and Micro each get n/2(may be floating number).(†value=n/2‡)

For each of the turns, Micro has to choose a set of integers(set may be singleton) such that for all the elements in the set, he gets a single value(see rules for clarification of value) which is the maximum possible value he can get when Ravi has chosen r. We call this set as †M‡.

†for given r, M={all those m for which value is maximum}‡.

Let the size of M in turn 0 be s0.
For r=1, size be s1 , and so on.

You have to print a number as:  †s0s1s2s3......sn‡ to help Micro, a dear friend of yours.

†Example‡:

n=2

Now, Ravi choses integers from 0 to 2.

When Ravi chooses 0:
If Micro chooses 0, value=0
If he chooses 1, value=1
If he chooses 2, value=2

So, for r=0, M={2} as value for 2 is maximum, †s0=1‡

When Ravi chooses 1:
If Micro chooses 0, value=0
If he chooses 1, value=1
If he chooses 2, value=1 as r=1,m=2 so r+m>n ans r

So, for r=1, M={1,2} as value=1 for both which is maximum for r=1. †s1=2‡

When Ravi chooses 2:
If Micro chooses 0, value=0
If Micro chooses 1, r=2,m=1 , value=m=1 as r+m>n and m
If Micro chooses 2, r=2,m=2 value=1 as r+m>n and r=m so , value=n/2=2/2=1

So, for r=2, M={1,2} as value=1 for both. †s2=2‡

So, answer for n=2 will be s0s1s2 which is †122‡.

†Input:‡
The first line contains †t‡ (number of test cases).
The following t lines contain †n‡ in each line.

Output:
