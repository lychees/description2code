Given an integer †N‡. Find eular toitent function of †N‡. Eular toitent function of †N‡ is total number of positive integers less than †N‡ which are co-prime to †N‡. Two numbers †A‡ and †B‡ are said to be co-prime if their †greatest common divisor‡ is 1. For eg 4 and 5 are co-prime to each other but 4 and 6 are not co-prime.

Input 
First line contains †T‡ (number of test cases). 
Next †T‡ lines contains integer †N‡.
