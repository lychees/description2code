Sandy is given an array of †N‡ integers which is a permutation of the first †N‡ natural numbers. He can swap any two elements of the array and can make at most †K‡ swaps. He needs to tell the largest permutation, in numerical order, could be made? You being sandy's friend help him in doing so.

†Input Format:-‡
The first line of the input contains two integers, †N‡ and †K‡, the size of the input array and the maximum swaps you can make, respectively. The second line of the input contains a permutation of the first †N‡ natural numbers.

†Output Format:-‡
Print the lexicographically largest permutation you can make with at most †K‡ swaps.

†Constraints:-‡
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ †K‡ ≤ 10^9

SAMPLE INPUT
5 1
4 2 3 5 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
5 2 3 4 1

Explanation

†Testcase 1:‡
You can swap any two numbers in [4,2,3,5,1] and see the largest permutation is [5,2,3,4,1]
†Other Example:-‡
†Input:-‡
3 1
2 1 3

†Output:-‡
3 1 2

With 1 swap we can get [1,2,3], [3,1,2] and [2,3,1] out of these [3,1,2] is the largest permutation
