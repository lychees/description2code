You are given two circles  C1 & C2 (centers , and radii are given), if area of circle-1 is A1 and that of circle-2 is A2 , you have to find whether area of union of these circle is the larger circle and area of intersection of these circle is smaller circle simultaneously , otherwise print "NOT SATISFIED".

Input 
first line contains †T‡ number of test cases ,
For each test case there will be two lines,first will contain centre †(x1,y1)‡ and †R1‡ radii of first circle  ,
and second line contains centre †(x2,y2)‡ and †R2‡ radii of second circle ,   

Output
if A1 UNION A2 = A1 and  A1 INTERSECTION A2 =A2 ,print "C1CC2" 
if A1 UNION A2 = A2 and A1 INTERSECTION A2 =A1 ,print "C2CC1"
if A1 UNION A2 = A2(or A1) and A1 INTERSECTION A2 =A1(or A2) ,print "C2~C1"
Otherwise print "NOT SATISFIED"  
Print without quotes(" ")

†Constraints:‡ 

x-coordinate , y-coordinate, and radius are from  0 to 100 (integer)
