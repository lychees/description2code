Milly loves chocolates very much. She is at the land of chocolates. This land has †N‡ rooms such that there are some chocolates of different brands in every room. It is possible that there can be multiple chocolates of same brand in a particular room. Now she is in a dilemma that whether she can eat at least †K‡ distinct branded chocolates at least once. Your task is to print the minimum number of rooms she must visit to eat at least those †K‡ distinct brands at least once.

†Note‡ : Once she enters a particular room, she will eat all of the chocolates available in that room.

Input

First line of the input will contain a integer T (number of test cases). 
Then for every test case there will be one line containing the values of  N (denoting the number of rooms) and K separated by a space.
Now each of the next N lines will first have a value P then P space separated strings denoting the names of the brands. 

 Output

For every test case, print the required answer and if it is not possible to eat those K distinct chocolates then print -1.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 3 
1 ≤ N  ≤ 16
 1 ≤ K ≤ 40 
 1 ≤ P ≤ 10
 1 ≤ Length of the strings ≤ 10
