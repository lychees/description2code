Once DJ Boy was travelling from Chandni Chowk to China . In his journey he encountered  N cities on his way numbered 0 to N-1 and also played Drums in some of the cities.
But since he is crazy he thought of playing drums in such a way that the minimum distance between any two cities in which he played drums should be as large as possible. Also he wished to play drums in atleast M cities(He never plays drums in source and destination city).
Given the distance of each of the N cities from the source city( Chandni Chowk ), DJ Boy wants to know the largest of the minimum distance between any two cities in which he played drums.

†Input:‡
First line of input contains an interger T denoting number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space seperated intergers N,M.
Second line of each test case contains array A of N intergers denoting distance from source city (A[i] is distance from of ith city from source city).
( 0th city is city just after the source city and (N-1)th city is city just before the destination city)

†Output:‡
For each test case,output the maximum value that is required.

†Constraints:‡
•   1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

•   2 ≤ N ≤ 1000

•   2 ≤ M ≤ N

•   1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9
