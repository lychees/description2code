My dear friend Anil has a quiet long name. One day he wrote a code which would automatically write his name whenever he wanted. Space was denoted by underscore('_'). But he forgot one important setting, due to which whole name got printed in lower case letter. 
Now he wants you to write a program which converts first letter of every word to its uppercase equivalent.

Note : String consists of only Lower Case Letters and underscores('_').

'_' Denote empty space
