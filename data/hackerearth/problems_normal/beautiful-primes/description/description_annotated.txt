John loves prime numbers. One day he was playing a game "primcia" with his wife alicia. The game is as follows, John write a number †N‡ on a table.

The number is of the form:

N =  (P1^A1) * (P2^A2) * .............. * (Px^Ax).

Where †Pi‡ are prime numbers and †Ai‡ are its corresponding powers.

Now, he asks Alicia to find the sum of all the numbers which are less than or equal to †N‡ and also contain all prime numbers which †N‡ contains in its prime factorization. For small numbers, Alicia can solve easily but it becomes too hard for large numbers. Help her to answer the query of john.

†Input:‡
First Line contains †T‡ test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines, 1st line contain †X‡ numbers of primes in †N‡, 2nd line contains †X‡ distinct prime numbers and 3rd line contain †X‡ powers. Each power †Ai‡ is power of †Pi‡.

†Output:‡
Output the Answer Modulo †10^9 +7‡.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †X‡ ≤ 100000
0 < †Pi‡ ≤1000000
1 ≤  †Ai‡ ≤ 1000000000

SAMPLE INPUT
1
3
2 3 5
2 1 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
90

Explanation

In given test case, The N will be 60.
So,  Numbers less than and equal to 60 having same prime numbers in its factorization are 60, 30, and So, sum=90.
