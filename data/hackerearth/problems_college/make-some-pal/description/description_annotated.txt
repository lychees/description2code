A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward. Given a string †s‡, you need to make it a palindrome by adding 0 or more characters to the end of †s‡, and remember, we want the palindrome to be as short as possible. 

†INPUT‡

First line is †T‡, the number of test cases.
T strings follow, every string †s‡ needs to be converted to palindrome.

†OUTPUT‡

Print the shortest possible length of a palindrome that John can generate.

†CONSTRAINTS‡
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive, palindrome can be larger in length.
Each character of s will be a lowercase letter ('a' - 'z').

SAMPLE INPUT
3
abab
abacaba
qwerty

SAMPLE OUTPUT
5

11

Explanation

CASE 1: "ababa" is the shortest palindrome that we can get.
CASE 2: Already a palindrome.
CASE 3: All characters are different.
