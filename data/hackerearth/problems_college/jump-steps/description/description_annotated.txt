After loosing two wickets in two balls, the match between India and Bangladesh has turned into last ball thriller. Bangladesh need 2 runs of the last ball. It is the short of length delivery outside off, Shuvagata Hom has a slash and misses, Mustafizur Rahman makes the sprint for the other end to steal a run.
Mustafizur starts at the co-ordinate †0‡ and the other end of pitch is at co-ordinate †N‡. 
He can jump from co-ordinate †i‡ to co-ordinate †j‡ if ->  
i < j 
j-i is a power of 2 (1,2,4, 8 so on).

 Chotu Singh Dhoni, the captain of Indian Cricket team needs to find out the minimum number of steps in which Mustafizur can reach the striker's end so that he can dislodge the bails before Mustafizur completes the run.

Input
First line of input contains an integer †T‡ denoting number of test cases.
Next †T‡ lines contains an integer †N‡ .
 
Output
For each test case output the minimum number of steps that Dhoni needs to know.

Constraints
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^18

SAMPLE INPUT
2
2
10

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1
2

Explanation

For the first Test case Mustafizur can  jump directly to co-ordinate 2 as the difference (2-0 = 2 is a power of 2). Hence, minimum number of steps required is 1. 
For the second case to reach co-ordinate 10 he can first jump to co-ordinate 2 and then to co-ordinate 10 (as 10-2 = 8 is a power of 2). Hence, minimum steps = 2.
