Explanation

There is nothing to bother about the 1st exam. But Chinna needs to improve in the second test and can make a progress of 110 with 1 hour coaching. Performance has increased for 3rd test so no coaching required. For 4th one, he should make a progress of 977 with 11 hours of coaching. For last one, he needs 6 hours of coaching to make the progress to 1034.
So, in total, 18 hours are required.
