My friend has just got his seperate room. He decided to paint a wall of the room with multiple colors.
For this purpose he has divided the wall into a grid of M X N. He has already reserved one cell for our beautiful snapshot that was taken when we were kids.

He wants to paint the remaining portion of the wall in a certain manner. He is provided with infinite L shaped tromino blocks (one for each color). 
Refer pictures for better understanding

He wants to calculate the maximum square area that contains the snap and can be painted using these tromino blocks without any overlaps.

INPUT :
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. first line of every test case contains 2 space separated integers N and M and the second line contains 2 space separated integers X and Y - coordinates of the SNAPSHOT

OUTPUT :
The maximum square area asked above

CONSTRAINTS :
T ≤ 10^5
 N,M ≤10^9 
 X ≤ N,Y ≤M
