Max has a rectangular prism with dimensions †A, B‡, and †C‡. He writes †A, B,‡ and †C‡ on piece of paper. When he is not looking, Andrew replaces these numbers with †X=A+B, Y=B+C, and Z=A+C‡. Now, Max sees three numbers †X, Y, Z‡ on the piece of paper. But Max needs help computing the surface area of this rectangular prism. Help him!

Input

First line contains †T‡ - number of test cases.

Each of next T lines contains 3 integers, †X, Y, Z‡, in that order. It is guaranteed that numbers †X, Y, Z‡ are accurate and †A, B, C‡ form dimensions of a prism.

Output

Output surface area of each original prism in a new line. Round your answer to 2 decimal places.

Constraints

T ≤ 10

2 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 10^7

SAMPLE INPUT

6.00

Explanation

The first test case is a prism with sides 1, 2, 3. The second test case is a cube of side 1. The surface area of the first prism is then 1x2+2x3+1x3+1x2+2x3+1x3=22, and the surface area of the 2nd prism is 6.
