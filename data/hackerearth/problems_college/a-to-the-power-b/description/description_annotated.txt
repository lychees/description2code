Ranjeet has recently learned how to calculate power of base †x‡ to †y‡ . Now people being jealous of him all sat together and framed a tough question to show that he has not learned anything. They gave him a base †x‡ and a list of numbers †A‡. They asked him what would be the answer of †x‡ to the power †product of all numbers in a list‡ . 
For example  let x = 2 and list = {1,2,3} then you have to print 2^(1 x 2 x 3). Now for larger values there would be no way to type the long answer so they asked him to calculate the answer modulo †M‡ 

†NOTE : For all test files M will be always coprime to the base X‡

Input
First line contains †N‡,†x‡ and †M‡ as input. Next line contains †N‡ space separated numbers 

Constraints
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ †M‡ ≤ 10^9+7
1 ≤ †x‡ ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ †A[i]‡ ≤ 10^18

SAMPLE INPUT
3 2 9
1 2 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1

Explanation

Product of all the numbers is 6. 2^6 = 64 . 64 mod 9 is 1
