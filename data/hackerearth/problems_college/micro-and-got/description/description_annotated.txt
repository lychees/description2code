Spoilers Ahead!!!. Micro just saw the †9^{th}‡ episode of the GoT season †6‡. When he saw Jon beat Ramsay on face, that moment, the episode became his favorite episode of the entire series. He got very excited and went to his friend Ravi's home to spoil it for him. But Ravi had a surprise for him. When Micro came he gave him a string †S‡ made of lower case characters. So Micro decided not to spoil the episode for him but to give him a hint. If the string has a substring that is a permutation of the string "jonwinsramsaydies", then Micro will tell him "You know everything Ravi" otherwise he will tell him "You know nothing Ravi". The string is really large so Micro needs help.

Permutation of a string is an arrangement of its characters. For example all the permutations of the string "abc" are : {"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"}

†Input:‡
The only line of input consists of a string †S‡ made of lower case english alphabets. 

†Output:‡
Print "You know everything Ravi"(without quotes), if †S‡ has a substring that is a permutation of "jonwinsramsaydies" otherwise print "You know nothing Ravi"(without quotes).

†Constraints:‡
†1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5‡ 

SAMPLE INPUT
