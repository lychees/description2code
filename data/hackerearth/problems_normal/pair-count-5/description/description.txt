You are given an array A = \{ a_0, a_1...a_{N-1} \} and an integer D. Find the total number of un-ordered pairs (i, j) where i \ne j such that a_i * a_j \equiv 0 \pmod D.

INPUT

The first line of each test file contains two space separated integers N and D, where N denotes the size of array A and D is as described above. Next line contains N space separated integers a_0 \dotso a_{N-1} denoting array A .

OUTPUT

Output a single line containing the number of pairs as described in problem statement. 

CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ D ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

SAMPLE INPUT
7 7
2 2 2 7 2 2 1 

SAMPLE OUTPUT
6

Explanation

You can take number at index 4 (1 based indexing) with any of other 6 numbers. Their product will be divisible by D   i.e. 7. No other pair will give product divisible by D.
