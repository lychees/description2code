Xenny had †N‡ numbers and he loved †equal triplets‡ (An equal triplet is group of 3 numbers that are equal).
He defined a K-equal-triplet as a triplet in which all 3 integers were equal to †K‡.
Given an integer †K‡, he wanted to find out the probability of getting a †K-equal triplet‡, from the †N‡ numbers.

Xenny is bad at understanding floating point numbers. Help him to find the probability in terms of a †fraction‡, reduced to its lowest terms.

Input
First line contains a single integer - †T‡, the total number of testcases.
†T‡ testcases follow.
Each testcase consists of 2 lines:
First line contains 2 space-separated integers - †N‡ and †K‡, which represent the total number of integers Xenny had, and the value †K‡ whose K-equal-triplet was required.

Output
For each testcase, print the †probability‡ of finding a K-equal-triplet in terms of the †lowest fraction‡.
For example, if the answer is 4/8, you must print 1/2, which is the lowest reduced fraction of 4/8.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ Numbers ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

Note: 

1) 2 testcase files are large (about 20 MB) in size. Please use fast I/O in your code.
2) Candidates need to attempt only one of the given problems

SAMPLE INPUT
1
5 4
1 4 4 4 1

SAMPLE OUTPUT
1/10

Explanation

K = 4
There is exactly †one‡ triplet (4, 4, 4) that can be selected from the given numbers.
Hence, the probability of selecting a 4-equal-triplet is 1/10.
