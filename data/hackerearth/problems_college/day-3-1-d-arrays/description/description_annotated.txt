†Problem‡

Babai and Diti are fighting for a box of chocolates. Their father decided to give them a simple algorithmic task to decide the winner. 

The winner will be the one who solves it first and he/she will win the box of chocolates. 

Babai and Diti are given an array of †N‡ integers. Each of the integers will be between †0 and 9‡ (both inclusive ). They have to report the †maximum length of subarray with the same first and last integer.‡

You being Diti's best friend and a programmer need to help her. Babai solves it manually but your program will always beat him. Help Diti win by generating the answer before Babai.

Input

First line comprises of †T‡ the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains the value of †N‡. The next line consists of N space separated integers, denoting the array of integers father gives to Babai and Diti.

Output

For every test case, print the answer on a new line denoting the maximum length of subarray with the same first and last integer.

Constraints

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 5

1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 100000

0 ≤ †Array elements‡ ≤9
