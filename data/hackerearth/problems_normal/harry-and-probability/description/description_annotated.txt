Harry is doing magic practice on X axis.He found 4 points A,B,C,D. Now consider line AB and CD ( |AB|=|CD| ) , he guesses an angle alpha and rotates line segment AB by angle alpha keeping B as center. He found that line segment CD also started rotating anti clock wise keeping center as C and by angle alpha. Now he wants to find probability of intersection of both line segments. 

Input
First line contains †T‡- no. of test cases.
Next T line contains 4 space separated integers - †A‡, †B‡, †C‡, †D‡.  which are x co ordinates of 4 points.  

Output
Print required probability with exact 6 decimal places.  

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ A,B,C,D ≤10^15
A < B < C < D
