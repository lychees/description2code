Little Pandey has †N‡ colorless balls.
His best friend GJ has †K‡ colors, numbered from †1‡ to †K‡.
Little Pandey assigns to GJ the task of coloring each ball, as GJ is a little free these days.
For the †i‡-th ball GJ chooses color †Ci‡.

But, Little Pandey is tired and bored after the trip.
He decides to find the total number of some special subsets of balls - subsets containing balls of at most †M‡ distinct colors.
This task is too complicated to handle for Pandey's tired mind, so he asks for your help, since he cannot expect a lot of help from GJ!

†Input format:‡
The first line of the input consists of three integers †N‡, †K‡ and †M‡. The next line consists of †N‡ integers †C1 , C2 ... CN‡ denoting colors of balls.

†Output format:‡
Print the total number of subsets such that each subset contains balls of at most †M‡ distinct colors. Output it modulus 10^9 + 7, i.e., 1000000007.

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ K, N ≤ 5*10^5
1≤ M ≤ 10
1 ≤ Ci ≤ K

Explanation

There are †2^4 = 16‡ possible subsets and †13‡ of them satisfy the given condition (a subset must contain balls of at most †M = 2‡ distinct colors).
These †13‡ subsets are {} , {1} , {2} , {3} , {4} , {1,2} , {1,3} , {1,4} , {1,4,2}  , {1,4,3} , {2,3} , {2,4} , {3,4}  
Numbers in braces denote indices of balls.
