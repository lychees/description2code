Probably, you have already read some problems but you still have not met any problems with queries on segments. Therefore Benny wants to fix it.

She gives you an array A of N elements.  And then you have to answer Q queries.

Each query consists of three integers L, R, X. Your task is to find such Ai, that L ≤ i ≤ R and Ai xor X is maximal. For each query output the maximum of Ai xor X.

Input format

The first line contains two integers N and Q.
The next line contains N integers Ai.
The next Q lines contain three integers L, R, X.

Output format

For each query output the maximum of Ai xor X in a single line.

Constraints
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 5 * 10^5
0 ≤ Ai < 2^20
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
0 ≤ X < 2^20
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 3 * 10^3 holds for test cases worth 15% of the problem's score.
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5 holds for test cases worth 60% of the problem's score.
