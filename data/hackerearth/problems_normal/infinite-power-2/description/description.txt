Everyone is now in search for power! Some people think that some numbers have large powers so they use them a lot. After some search, Omar tried on many numbers to explore their powers, so now he know the numbers with infinite power!

The numbers with infinite powers are really easy to find, they are numbers which have all their digits as even numbers, so 24 has infinite power but 12 doesn't have infinite power.  

But now there are only small amount of infinite power numbers. So Omar starts again searching about numbers with large (but not infinite) powers. He found out that power of a number (N) is equal to division of absolute difference between N and the number with infinite number not less than N over absolute difference between N and the number with infinite number not greater than N.

So given a number, help Omar finding power of the number.  

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer (T), number of test cases.
For each test case an integer N is given in new line.  

Output Format: 
If the number has infinite power, output "Unlimited Power" (without quotes) in a separate line, otherwise output the required ratio (in the most simplified form) in a separate line.  

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10 ^ 6  
1 ≤ N ≤ 10 ^ 9 

Note: Large I/O files. Use faster input, output methods.

SAMPLE INPUT
2
11
22

SAMPLE OUTPUT
3/1
Unlimited Power

Explanation

Case #1:

\frac{20 - 11}{11 - 8} = \frac{9}{3} = 3/1
