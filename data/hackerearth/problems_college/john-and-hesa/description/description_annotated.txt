At last, John will have to tell, On now many targets he shoot i.e. †N‡ and as well as remaining amount of the John. Help John to get selected in HESA.

†INPUT:‡

First line contains number of test cases †T‡.

For each test case, a single line represents two space separated integers †X‡ and †P‡.

†OUTPUT:‡

For each test case, print the value of †N‡.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10

1 ≤ †X‡ ,  †P‡ ≤ 100000
