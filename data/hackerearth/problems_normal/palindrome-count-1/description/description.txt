Given a string S, count the number of non empty sub strings that are palindromes.
A sub string is any continuous sequence of characters in the string.
A string is said to be palindrome, if the reverse of the string is same as itself.
Two sub strings are different if they occur at different positions in S

Input
Input contains only a single line that contains string S.   

Output
Print a single number, the number of sub strings that are palindromes.

Constraints
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 50
S contains only lower case latin letters, that is characters a to z.

SAMPLE INPUT
dskjkd

SAMPLE OUTPUT
7

Explanation

The 7 sub strings are d, s, k, j, k, d, kjk.
