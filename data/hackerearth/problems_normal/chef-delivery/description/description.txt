Our chef has opened a delivery agency. His prime moto is "earn money". He
is very strict on excessive consumption of petrol by his agency vehicles.
So he has fixed a daily limit on the amount of petrol consumed.

Now the management at his agency have got the following problem.

There are n vehicles in the agency n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)   represented
by numbers 1,2,3..n. Each kth vehicle can be used by the agency can be
used only if it has atleast k litres of fuel.
Each of the kth vehicle has initially pk litres of petrol.
The capacity of each kth vehicle is  ck tonnes .
The goal of the management is to maximimize the total capacity in tonnes, given the max limit on petrol in litres.
 
Input
First line contains t the number of test cases.
Then follow 3 lines for each testcase.
First line : integers n (number of vehicles) and m , max litres of petrol that can be used. 
Second line: n integers pk: initial capacity of  kth  vehicle.
Third line: n integers ck: capacity of kth vehicle
 Output
Corresponding to each testcase print the max weight of delivery in tonnes that can be achieved by the management.
 Constraints 
1 ≤ n,m ≤ 1000
1 ≤ pk ≤ k
1 ≤ ck ≤ 10^9

Explanation

1st testcase: Since their is no fuel requirement so maximum capacity will be  sum of capacities of all vehicles
2nd testcase :  Management will fill in 2 litres in the third vehicle. So total capacity will be  4+6=10 litres.
