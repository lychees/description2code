One day while playing with parentheses '{' and '}' , Panda came across an interesting question , given a string A consisting of parentheses we've to perform the following operation: Given two integers L and R,find the length of correct parentheses subsequence.

Note: All the indices (L and R) for above operation are according to 1 indexed.  

†INPUT:‡ 
First line of input contains a string comprising of parentheses '{'and '}'.
Second line contains T the number of queries. 
Next T lines contains two space separated integers L and R.

†OUTPUT:‡
For each query print length of correct parentheses subsequence in new line. 

Constraints
1 ≤ |Length of the string| ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5  
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^5

Explanation

For Query 1: correct Bracket subseqence length is 0 {{.  
For Query 5: correct Bracket subseqence length is 2 {}}.
