It's the rainy season again, and the city experiences frequent showers throughout the day.

The weather report says that there is a †P‡ probability of rainfalls today. Raj has to step out for a meeting at the office, and would like to know the probability that it rains during the time he is on the way.

†Input:‡

The first line of input contains the number of test cases, †T‡. Each of the following †T‡ lines contain two numbers, †P‡ and †time‡. †P‡ denotes the probability that it will rain today and †time‡ is the time (in minutes), it will take for Raj to reach his office.

†Output:‡

Output should have †T‡ lines each containing answer to corresponding test case. Please round the answer to 4 decimal places.

†Constraints:‡

1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 100
0 ≤ †P‡ ≤ 0.5
10 ≤ †time‡ ≤ 720
†time is a perfect divisor of 1440.‡
