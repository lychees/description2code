Let's define the function †F(l,r)‡ :

† F(l,r) ‡ = † \sum x‡, †\forall  x ‡, where †x‡ is a prime number between †l‡ and †r‡ inclusive.  

In Short, for each function †F(l,r)‡ you need to find the summation of all primes between the integers †l‡ and †r‡ inclusive.  

Now, you shall be given multiple queries. In each query, you shall be given the integers †l‡ and †r‡ and you need to find the result of the function †F(l,r)‡ 

†Input Format‡:

The first line contains a single integer †N‡ denoting the number of queries. Each of the next †N‡ lines contains two integers †l‡ and †r‡ denoting the parameters of the †i^{th}‡ query.          

†Output Format‡:

For each query, output the answer on a new line. 

Constraints

For †30‡ Points:

† 1 ≤q N ≤q 1000 ‡ 

† 1 ≤q l ≤q r ≤q 1000 ‡

For the next †70‡ Points:

† 1 ≤q N ≤q 5*10^5 ‡ 

† 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^6 ‡

Explanation

For the †1^{st}‡ query, the primes between †1‡ and †6‡ are †2‡, †3‡ and †5‡. Thus the answer= †2 + 3 + 5‡ = †10‡.
Similarily, for the second query, Answer = †5 + 7 + 11 + 13‡ = †36‡.
