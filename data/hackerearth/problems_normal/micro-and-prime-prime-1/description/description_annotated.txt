Micro just learned about prime numbers. But he quickly got bored of them, so he defined a new kind of numbers and called them †Prime Prime‡ Numbers. A number †X‡ is †Prime Prime‡ if number of prime numbers from †1‡ to †X‡ (inclusive) are prime. Now he wants to find out the number of Prime Prime numbers from †L‡ to †R‡ (inclusive). Help Micro with it. 

†Input:‡
First line consists of a single integer †T‡ denoting number of test cases
Following †T‡ lines consists of two space separated integers denoting †L‡ and †R‡

†Output:‡
Print the number of Prime Prime Numbers for each between †L‡ and †R‡ for each test case in a new line. 

†Constraints:‡
† 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5‡
† 1 ≤ L, R ≤ 10^6‡
