The evil mastermind, Moriarty, strikes again!  He sent Sherlock an image of a wall, with †N‡ integers painted on it. Sherlock is asked to solve the puzzle and find the next clue.
Sherlock knows that Moriarty is a deceitful person. All the numbers painted on the wall are not valid. Only the numbers that are Coprime with the integer †X‡ are valid, and the rest are a deceit. Help Sherlock find the valid integers from the given array †A‡ so that he can track down Moriarty.  

Input:
First line contains †T‡. †T‡ test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers †N‡ and †X‡.
Second line of each test case contains †N‡ space-separated integers, forming the array †A‡. 

Output:
Print the valid integers separated by spaces in the order that they appear in the list or "-1" (without the quotes) if there are no valid integers, in a new line for each test case.  

Constraints:
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 10
1 ≤ †N‡ ≤ 10^4
2 ≤ †Ai‡, †X‡ ≤ 10^7
