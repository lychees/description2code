In code world all genders are considered equal ( It means their is nothing like male or female). Now their are N distinct  persons living in this hypothetical world. Each person can pair up with any other person or can even  remain single. One day Vbhu planned to visit code world. Being a maths guy , he always try to be mathematical. So he started counting the ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or  remain single. A single person can make pair with at most one other person.Seeing that N can be large , Vibhu ask you for help. Now being a great programmer you need to help Vbhu count the number of ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or remain single. 

†Note‡ : Its not necessary that everyone is required to make pair with someone.  Person can remain single also.

†Input Format‡ :  First line contain number of test cases T. Then next T lines contain a single integer N , denoting the number of persons living in code world.

†Output Format‡ : You need to print the number of ways in which N different persons can make their pairs or stay single. As answer can be large so print it modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤10^5
1 ≤ N ≤10^6
†Warning: Large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages‡

Explanation

In first test case , For N=2 answer will be 2. Possible ways are :
    {1},{2} (It means Person 1 and Person 2 are single)
    {1,2}  (It means Person 1 and Person 2 had formed a pair)

For second test case , For N=3 , answer will be 4. Possible ways are :
    {1},{2},{3} (It means all three Persons are single)
    {1,2},{3} (It means Person 1 and Person 2 had formed a pair and Person 3 is single)
    {1},{2,3} (It means Person 2 and Person 3 had formed a pair and Person 1 is single)
    {1,3},{2} (It means Person 1 and Person 3 had formed a pair and Person 2 is single)
