Teja is extremely enthusiastic about competitive programming , but sometimes fails miserably even for easy problems. Utkarsh , his best friend gave him one array A of N elements , to perform the given operation.

Given two integers P and Q , Teja needs to find Q elements of the given array which are closest to P ,with each having atleast 1 prime factor in common with P.

Note that these Q elements should be in non-decreasing order. Also, if obtaining such condition is not possible , print “-1” without  quotes.

Question update : Incase of multiple answers, select the minimum number. Eg. if P=15 and you need to decide between 12 and 18, select 12.

Input :

T -  the number of test cases.
For each test case , you have 3 lines of input.

First line has N- number of elements. 

Second line has array A .

Third line has 2 integers P and Q.

Output:-

For each test case , print the elements satisfying above condition in non-decreasing order separated by a space. 
If such a case is not possible , simply print “-1” without double quotes.

Constraints :

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5 
2 ≤ P ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100

Note:- If there are multiple answers possible , print the smallest ones .
For eg. 
N=2
array elements- 12 18
p=15
q=1
Possible answers are - 12 as well as 18
but smallest is 12.
So print 12

1 4 5 7 10

8 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT
4 10

Explanation

There is only 1 test case , comprising 5 elements -1,4,5,7,10 .
P is 8 and Q is 2.
Now for the given array we have 2 (i.e Q) closest elements with P are 4 and 10 , provided that they have 2 as common prime factor.
