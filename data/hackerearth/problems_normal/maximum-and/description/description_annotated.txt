Given two numbers †A‡ and †B‡. Find the value of pair (P,Q) such that †A ≤ P < Q ≤ B‡ value of †P AND Q‡ is maximum where AND is a binary operator. Refer to this link for more information about AND operator : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND 

†Input:‡
First line of input contains number of test cases †T‡. Each test case contains two numbers †A‡ and †B‡.  

†Output:‡ 
For each test case print the value of maximum AND.  

*Constraints: * 
1 ≤ †T‡ ≤ 1000
1 ≤ †A‡ < †B‡ ≤10^18
