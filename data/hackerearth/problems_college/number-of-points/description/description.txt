The problem statement is very simple.You are given two co-ordinates points on a infinite 2D plane.
Your task is to find total number of integral points lying between given co-ordinates.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow.
Each of the following T lines contains one test case each. Each test case contains 4 integers x1, y1, x2 and y2 separated by a single space.

Output

A single line containing the number of steps.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

-10^9 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9
