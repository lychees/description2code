Micro has got an internship at a well reputed company. But something started bothering him when he joined. It's been one month now and he's still not able to figure out what it is. But he did a lot of research and has finally found a way to know what that something is. During his research he took an array †A‡ of size †N‡, initialized with value †0‡ and performed †Q‡ operations on it. In one operation he added a  value †V‡ to all †A[i]‡ (where †X ≤ i ≤ Y‡). Now the something that's bothering him is sum of all †S(C)‡, where †C‡ is a subsequence of the array †A‡ and †S(C)‡ is the sum of all the elements in the subsequence †C‡. Help Micro find out this.  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

You will be provided with six integer values: †a, b, c, d, e, f‡. The †i^{th}‡ operation is defined by three values †X_i, Y_i, V_i‡, that means add †V_i‡ to all †A[k]‡, where †X_i ≤ k ≤ Y_i‡. Now these values are to be generated using the following formulas:

†X_i = ((X_{i-1} \times a) + b)\%N + 1; X_0 = 0‡

†Y_i = ((Y_{i-1} \times c) + d)\%N + 1; Y_0 = 0‡

If †X_i > Y_i‡: †Swap(X_i, Y_i)‡

†V_i = ((V_{i-1} \times e) + f)\%10^9 + 1; V_0 = 0‡

†Input:‡
First line of input consists of a single integer †T‡ denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting †N‡ and †Q‡.
Second line of each test case consists of six space separated integers denoting †a, b, c, d, e, f‡.

†Output:‡
Print the answer to each test case in a new line. As the answer can be large print it modulo †10^9+7‡.

†Constraints:‡
†1 ≤ T ≤ 10‡
†1 ≤ N, Q, a, b, c, d, e, f ≤ 10^6‡

Explanation

The 3 operations will be
†X_1 = 2, Y_1 = 2, V_1 = 2‡
†X_2 = 1, Y_2 = 1, V_2 = 4‡
†X_3 = 3, Y_3 = 3, V_3 = 6‡ 
So the array will be †A[] = \{4, 2, 6\}‡ 
All subsequences, †C‡ and the value of function †S(C)‡ will be
†C = \{4\}  ;S(C) = 4‡
†C = \{2\}   ;S(C) = 2‡
†C = \{6\}  ;S(C) = 6‡
†C = \{4, 2\}  ;S(C) = 6‡
†C = \{4, 6\}  ;S(C) = 10‡ 
†C = \{2, 6\}  ;S(C) = 8‡
†C = \{4, 2, 6\}  ;S(C) = 12‡ 
So sum all values of †S(C)‡ is 48
