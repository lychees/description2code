†Richard‡ and †Daniel‡ have been very naughty throughout the day. So their computer teacher gave them a problem and if they are able to solve it, he will reward the two of them. 
They are given a pair of words and their task is to determine whether the two words are the same or not.
•   If the two words match, print EXACT
•   If the two words don’t match, print NON EXACT and also, the count of the letters of the larger word that do not  match with respect to position.                             
Assume that the words contain only lower case letters. The maximum word length is 10.

†Input:‡ The first line of the data set for this problem is an integer that represents the number of pairs of words in the list(testcases T). Each word is on a separate line.

†Output:‡ Output EXACT or NON EXACT with the count. All letters are lower case.The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.
