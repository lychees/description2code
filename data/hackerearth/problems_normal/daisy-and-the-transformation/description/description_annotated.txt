Mack gives Daisy two strings †S1‡ and †S2‡-consisting only of characters- †'M' and 'D'‡ , and asks her to convert S1 to S2 in †exactly N moves.‡

In a single move, Daisy has two choices:
Exchange any one 'M' with a 'D', or
Exchange any one 'D' with a 'M'.

You need to help Daisy if it's possible to transform S1 to S2 in exactly N moves. Output "†Yes‡" if possible, else "†No‡".

†Input Format:‡
First line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow.
Each line consists of 2 space separated strings S1 and S2, and and the value N.

†Output Format:‡
For each test case, print the answer, either "Yes" or "No"-(Without the quotes).

†Constraints:‡
1 ≤ T ≤ 250
1 ≤ |S1|=|S2| ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
